            "The Shootist is one of the most unconventional westerns ever to feature the name of John Wayne. The genre legend was one never to break away from simplistic narrative tropes throughout the decades largely due to his conservative nature, though he did occasionally take on alternative approaches in cases such as The Searchers (1956) as a means of making slight adjustments to the changing times. In The Shootist, he takes on a role perfect for his age. Given that he was dealing with terminal cancer at the time he played the role, portraying an ageing gunman battling cancer is a role befitting enough to produce an effective swan song for the man's career.\n",
            "The Shootist is arguably the most character-driven film of John Wayne's career. While viewers may be deterred by the minimization of shootouts and horse chases, the depth of the film is frequently enough to compensate. It admittedly means that the film progresses at a slower rate than most films in the already-slow western genre and that there is less style-driven content to distract audiences. However, the extent of depth found in The Shootist is unprecedented for any John Wayne film. The main theme in The Shootist is the concept of death; while most John Wayne western films trivialize the idea of death to being little more than the afterthought of an action scene at best, The Shootist encourages viewers to truly consider its connotations. The protagonist is one who awaits his own death and the manner in which he is treated as a result. Forced to confont the world he is leaving behind and the terms he wishes to die on, The \n",
            "Shootist considers so much more to the idae behind death than most films would ever imagine. Frequently, that kind of mezmerising thought provocation is enough to keep viewers in the mood of the film and it is captured through a dedicated cast and a strong screenplay. Many viewers will find disappointed with the fact that the film doesn't match its title too much or live up to its generic contract as a John Wayne film, but Donald Siegel proves his worth as a creator of much more than just action cinema with The Shootist. It's a film which is against type for its star and director which results in unprecedented results for the audience.\n",
            "And even though it doesn't emphasize its imagery too heavily, The Shootist is still a stylish film. The western iconography works to easily convince viewers of the narrative context. The cinematography is steady, the monochromatic colour is gentle and the minimal action in the film is executed with powerful technique and even some effective blood. But all in all, John Wayne's performance is truly the major reason for anyone to see The Shootist as even people who aren't particularly fond of the western genre can appreciate the raw brilliance of his performance. The instant John Wayne rides up onto the screen it immediately becomes a sight to behold. The legendary actor still maintains the distinctive charm of his voice and heroic stature, but there is far more frailty to him this time around. There is a lot more character in his face as his expressions actually shift around a lot more this time, and its largely because the story doesn't hide him behind western iconography but rather demands he actually dedicate himself with a strong performance. There is tremendous heart in John Wayne's performance, and though he still carries the larger-than-life patriotic spirit within him, it takes a backseat to his genuine charisma as a man of legitimate dramatic talents. His reliance on the genuine emotion he conveys through his face and voice The Academy Award given to the actor for True Grit (1969) should have been savoured for The Shootist as it is truly the greatest effort of the man's career.\n",
            "Ron Howard is also put into top form. Between being the lovable Richard \"Richie\" Cunningham on the sitcom Happy Days (1974-1984) and becoming the Academy Award winning film director we know him as today, The Shootist served as a powerful medium for the actor's dramatic talents. His chemistry with John Wayne is remarkable because as well as standing as his own character, there is a real sense of admiration that Ron Howard expresses in his character as he looks up to John Bernard \"J.B\" Books. More and more we see elements of John Wayne's former glory reflecting in Ron Howard through the actor's own charms, and the fact that he carries this while also standing his own ground as a respectable dramatic performer is a firm achievement. Ron Howard delivers one of the most accomplished performances of his career, and his interactions with John Wayne make him one of the finest actors to have ever shared the screen with the western legend.\n",
            "Teaming up John Wayne with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) collaborator James Stewart and Blood Alley (1955) collaborator Lauren Bacall, The Shootist boasts a lot of appeal with its classical film stars which helps to fulfil aspects of the generic contract left blank by the absence of action. John Wayne's shared moments with these greats evokes different results from the respective actors; James Stewart's sophistication creates an incredibly direct relationship between the two, whereas in the case of Lauren Bacall there is constantly a sense of mystery over how their relationship will develop. Scatman Crothers is also a nice touch, so every cast member of The Shootist can be credited to bringing out the absolute best in John Wayne.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Shootist lacks the patriotic action which is typically offered by John Wayne films, but it more than makes up for it in with a deep and meaningful examination of death propelled by the greatest performance of John Wayne's career and the support of the remarkable cast around him.\n",
            "\n",
            "This classic Western was great. John Wayne, Ron Howard, Lauren Bacall, James Stewart, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot of the movie was entertaining and dramatic. It's about doing something good when you don't much time to live and settling unfinished business. If you haven't seen this classic movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.\n",
            "\n",
            "This isn't a swan song; that wouldn't fit John Wayne.

The reason I was shocked to learn it was his last film was because he was SO handsome and gorgeous in this movie!  So I thought, I wonder when he made this movie?  Maybe 15-20 years before he passed?  Wow!  He sure looks good!  Then when I read it was his last, I was even more blown away by the whole movie! Not only his iconic looks, but his acting!!  It's marvelous! I mean, he's iconic for a reason!  His acting was iconic!

            "You almost can't seperate the character from the legend of the actor that gives his last ride. That being said even if you don't know anything about Wayne or that this was his last film it's got such multi faceted layers of symbolism and commentary it's hard not be drawn in and engaged the entire way. From a historical setting of the turn of the century, the dying of the old ways, new inventions add a layer to something already filled with tons of commentary on death and finding ones place in society for yourself and others. On top of that for fans of the genre, the fact that this is a golden era star giving his his last performance in a New Hollywood picture is poetic in itself on top of mirroring Wayne's real life only a short time later. Fundamentally speaking what carries this is this all this adds such tremendous weight for a western in a short period of time and provides a perfect heavy pacing and excellent cinematography and acting. Everyone is really good but it's Wayne who really makes it something special especially for fans who know this is last ride. The only minor complaints are the editing is really good but could be tighter with it feeling like stuff just happens at points but do add character and commentary. It would've been nice to maybe see Wayne interact with his old foes more but it still works well. The music is also really good but it's not used that much because of how serious the tone is and rightfully so but it may have helped to use it a bit more. This isn't the type of Western that you would think it would be and is more so a character study drama than anything else with ahrdly any action save for the end. It's a great way for The Duke to go out. Everyone should give this a shot. All Time Classic.\n",

Lastly the main villain is typical of the western, the saloon owner slash criminal.  Plus he doesn't get much screentime. John Wayne really pulls out all the stops in his last performance.  It's sincere and heartfelt, like he already knew his day was coming to a close and wanted to give the world something to really remember him by.  Hell, he should have won an Oscar for it.

The film works best in its quiet moments, as we regard the Duke's tenderness and dignity; qualities which quickly evoke a stirring awareness of Wayne's frequently underappreciated acting abilities. On a more general level, the film tends to disengage us with characters that are poorly developed, including villains who appear to exist as mere contrivances, a marshal with an unconvincingly flippant disregard for the Wayne character, and a boy whose adulation springs forth with the arbitrary energy born only of plot convenience. As an elegy to the inestimable John Wayne, \"The Shootist\" is likely to please many fans, but for those who are looking for masterful story and character construction, disappointment will likely follow.\n",

            "\"The Finest Hours\" is a solid and old-school movie about heroism. When the movie gets going there are plenty of exhilarating moments that had me invested. The movie seems to rush the exposition and ending and I think it could have been an even longer and more fleshed-out movie. I still think it is technically well made and acted and I was engaged with the rescue at the center of the story. Overall, it is a solid thrill ride with an emotional center and plenty of entertainment value.\n",

This was an incredible heroic story, based on a true story. It was very suspenseful and emotional. Why it did not do well at the box office is a mystery and the movie's it was up against were no competition at all.  Perhaps the critics had something to do with that. How it could have received \"mixed\" reviews defies logic and reason. That any critic would not rate an incredible movie like this very highly is remarkable. I highly recommend this movie. It was recommended to me by a friend. These are the real heroes that the best movies are made of. Unbelievable to me that it did not clean up at the academy awards. Cinematography was incredible, acting was incredible and to top it off it was based on a true story that is an inspiration to people of most ages (probably too intense for younger viewrs) and walks of life! I don't think heroes like this even exist anymore which is all the more reason the movie stood out ot me as so incredible and inspirational.\n",

I thought something was missing from this film to make it stand out more. Possibly it is because we do not learn more about the Coast Guard crew more and maybe if there was more back story to those characters I would have been more invested emotionally if more depth was provided even with hints of information provided in dialogue or exposition.

I really liked the acting (and characters) of Casey Affleck and Chris Pine.  The CGI looked impressive and real to me.

This movie doesn't need to \"change lives\" or present some unprecedented study of a rescue movie. Although it would have been nice if the second ship's POV was also included, it would unquestionably bloat the runtime, so it is understandable why it got completely cut.

            "In 1977, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) graduate from the University of Chicago. Harry is dating Sally's friend Amanda Reese, leading to Harry and Sally ride-sharing to New York City. Sally is attending journalism school there and Harry has a job waiting. During the drive, Harry and Sally discuss their differing ideas about relationships; Sally disagrees with Harry's assertion that men and women cannot be friends as, \"the sex part gets in the way\". They stop at a diner, and when Harry tells Sally she is very attractive, she angrily accuses him of making a pass. They part company in New York, never intending to see each other again. Five years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight. Sally is dating Harry's neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged to Helen, which surprises Sally, as it seems uncharacteristically optimistic of him. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding that they will not be friends. Five years later in 1987, Harry and Sally run into each other at a bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships; Sally and Joe broke up and Helen left Harry for another man. They agree to pursue a friendship and have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together discussing their love-lives...\n",

            "Rotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads, \"Rob Reiner's touching, funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\" The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner \"one of Hollywood's very best directors of comedy\", and said the film was \"most conventional, in terms of structure and the way it fulfills our expectations. But what makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan.\" In a review for The New York Times, Caryn James called When Harry Met Sally... an \"often funny but amazingly hollow film\" that \"romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers\"; James characterized it as \"the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu\". Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised Meg Ryan as the \"summer's Melanie Griffith – a honey-haired blonde who finally finds a showcase for her sheer exuberance. Neither naif nor vamp, she's a woman from a pen of a woman, not some Cinderella of a Working Girl.\" Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \"Crystal is funny enough to keep Ryan from all-out stealing the film. She, though, is smashing in an eye-opening performance, another tribute to Reiner's flair with actors.\" David Ansen provided one of the rare negative reviews of the film for Newsweek. He criticized the casting of Crystal, \"Not surprisingly he handles the comedy superbly, but he's too cool and self-protective an actor to work as a romantic leading man\", and felt that as a film, \"of wonderful parts, it doesn't quite add up\".\n",

I personally don´t like Billy Crystal¨s character Harry Burns, which is an annoying know it all sexist that never seize to stop talking, while while Meg Ryan´s character is more balanced despite her flaws and issues. They simply don´t fit together in my point of view. And their prolonged relation that goes from not liking eachother to friends to a couple has a way too long transport stretch. I love Meg Ryan back then, she has such a great natural way of acting and she was adorable in 1989. However, I think the best scene is the orgasm one at the Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan. Hands down. The rest is not that exciting in my book. \n",

It might seem like a very ordinary film now, but it set standards for a romantic comedy to be good in its time. It is wonderfully entertaining and pretty straightforward.\n",

Meg Ryan y Billy Crystal tienen química, mucha química, y un guion maravilloso para trabajar, por no mencionar a Rob Reiner que los dirige con libertad de improvisar, así que es una receta para el éxito. El reparto conforma un retrato comparable a la vida de cualquier persona (incluso quienes no llevan una relación amorosa), y sugiere lo que se puede experimentar en busca del amor con humor, optimismo y algo de dolor, sin dejar de ser un fugaz clásico.

            "A naive and idealistic Nazi officer (Howard Vernon) is quartered in the home of an elderly Frenchman (Jean-Marie Robain) and his niece (Nicole Stephane) during the German occupation of France. The pair's only possible defiance in the wake of their unwelcome guest is cold, contemptuous silence. Le SIlence De La Mer was faithfully adapted from a popular novel clandestinely published under the nose of Vichy France. Its director, who was involved in the French Resistance, began shooting the movie a mere two years after World War II ended; the emotions about the Nazi occupation were still very raw and this is felt in every frame of the film. Despite (or because) of all this, Jean Pierre Melville's feature debut is a powerful and intense film in many ways. However, thanks in no small part to the spot-on cinematography and some great acting, Le Silence De La Mer is also understated and deeply humanizing in many of its other aspects.\n",

The story is an interesting one, set in Nazi occupied France, a man and his niece wage a war of passive resistance by never speaking to or acknowledging the presence of a Nazi officer who is living in their home.  The film is more an artistic exercise than is powerful storytelling.  Also, the film seems to have an excess of narration, even narrating what the audience can simply see on the screen.  Still, it's well photographed, well acted, and is a high quality film considering the low budget.\n",

I adored how the film has this approach to it that doesn't blindly villify anyone but displays how man sometimes is just weak and incapable when superior forces force him into a spot.

An unforgettable experience.\n",

            "Le Silence de la Mer was often called an anti-cinematic film by it's aspiring new Director, Jean-Pierre Melville.  He went outside the film industry in order to make the film and didn't even have the rights to the source material when he filmed it.  The film itself is one in which a lot happens and is narrated by the German officer and his interactions with a French man and his daughter, with whom he lodges.  The German's are invading France and while under occupation they are stuck with this German officer with whom is very outspoken.  While most of what the officer says is simply concerning music, art, cultures, other topics include philosophical observations and ideals.  The man and his daughter are silent the entire film as this officer goes on and on and it's only out of defiance they maintain their silence.  Near the end of the film the officer is finally awakened to the true cruelty of the Nazi party and his superiors views and it's this that enlightens him and he decides to depart to the front lines, disenchanted and dumbfounded.  We hear the daughter utter goodbye to him, the first and only word spoken to him in the entire film.\n",
            "     Le Silence de la Mer or The Silence of the Sea is very simplistic, both in it's filming technique and it's characters but it's entirely lyrical and thought provoking in it's subject matter.  This is one of the only films in which the French resistance is shown and the German officers, at least some of them, are not all shown as monstrous brainwashed machines.  Granted, our central character is the only one that isn't a true monster but this depiction is what I believe to be honest and true as not every single one could have been so heartless.  Certainly the film shows their crimes and terrible inhuman ideals but also that not every one was truly in the know about Hitler's true intentions, at least outside the inner circle.  The film was not only beautiful but also showed something rarely seen and had a profound effect on many other French directors afterwards, including Robert Bresson and Alain Resnais.  While mostly lost on the American audiences, the film was well received in its native country and was prolific as the debut film of Melville.  This was a pleasure to watch and truly an eye opening and inspiring film.\n",

            "And so Jean-Pierre Melville's career began with this very impressive feature debut. While not quite the same kind of film from him as I'm used to (keep in mind the only other Melville films I've seen are Le Deuxième Souffle and Le Samouraï), it delivers every bit of quiet tension and restrained filmmaking I've come to love from this director. The vast majority of the film is either narration directly out of the book on which the film was adapted, or Howard Vernon delivering hauntingly beautiful monologues. Vernon's performance is flawless and never fails to draw you in. All of this great stuff aside,Le Silence de la Mer has some room to grow. Biggest issue being that it's basically a stage play. The medium is hardly utilized and it makes for a semi-dull viewing. This isn't the fault of Melville or anybody else, that's just what the source material calls for. As perfectly executed as Vernon's monologues were, I just can't help but feel that the story could have had so much more to offer. But this, again, is the fault of the author of the book, not Melville. All in all, Le Silence de la Mer is a very good start to Melville's career and definitely one not to let pass you by.\n",

            "Melville's first film is very good indeed.  Drawn from a popular short story circulated by the French Resistance during WWII, it depicts a German officer taking forced lodging with an elderly French man and his niece.  The German is full of romantic notions of a merger of French poetry and literature with German classical music, a marriage of two cultures, and although the man and his niece refuse to speak to him or even acknowledge his presence, he delivers them nightly monologues that make him a sympathetic character.  Unfortunately, the reality of the Nazis' aims is eventually made clear and the German is seriously disillusioned.  Melville's attention to small details (and sounds) is already apparent and he decorates the film with expressionistic touches (point of view shots, close-ups of eyes, distant views of Chartres, etc).\n",

            "Melville fans searching for another moody crime film from the director should look to the recently released 'Le deuxieme souffle' or to the late-great 'Un Flic', because they'll find no such beast here. To quote the man himself, this film was made back when Melville wasn't \"terrified of poetry\", and so it evidences a slightly different artistic personality than the one behind his iconic 'Le Samourai' (though it could be argued that 'Le Samourai' is simply film-poetry in another idiom). \n",
            "\n",
            "'Le Silence de la Mer' finds Melville in what has to be his most nakedly literary mode. And of course there's an obvious reason for this in the fact that the film is a pretty exacting adaptation of Vercors' famous resistance novel. But while filmmakers usually get flack for narration-heavy adaptations, Melville I think has to be praised for his fidelity to the source, because his decision to tackle the novel almost line-by-line is both aesthetic AND political. It's aesthetic in that the book's central thematic dichotomy of silence vs. speech can only be realized cinematically via the counterpoint of inner/outer monologues that Melville uses here. And it's political in that the text is freighted from cover to cover with \"Le mythe de la Resistance\", and too much deviation in 1949 so soon after the close of the war could be construed as trivialization. (Melville actually agreed to have the film judged by a \"jury\" of resistance members to ensure its legitimacy, and he swore that if they condemned it he'd burn the prints.) So if the film perhaps plays like a musical theater piece, it seems wholly appropriate artistically and attributable to an amount of reverence for Vercors and the resistance writ large (which Melville himself was a part of).\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, Melville DOES deviate a bit in an effort to embellish the story (most off-puttingly when he references the then-nonexistent concentration camp Treblinka in a 1941 setting), but no particular scene save for Ebrennac's blindingly allegorical flashback seems not of a piece with the whole. I think it's important to consider the mythical aspects of the film when reckoning with it, because certain of the characterizations may ring falsely if divorced from the immediate post-war \"Frenchness\" of their origin. And I think in the final analysis this is much more a tale of humans working through a long and embattled reconciliation than it's a story of persisting divides. Certainly WWII created some of the deepest and most harrowing schisms yet known between man and his fellow men, but Melville stresses here that even these incredible divisions are somehow bridgeable with the aid of culture, conversation (even one-sided!), and something as simple as shared livingspace. It's not tea with Hitler -- nor will it ever be -- but it's some kind of gesturing toward a principled, universal sympathy for humanity.

In his place we have Charles Laughton, who tosses every trope you might think of for a stuffy English barrister - fussy, detail-obsessed, clever, fastidious, intolerable, and brimming with dry humor - a brings them to life in Sir Wilfrid Robarts. Pitted against him is the mysterious Christine Vole, played with equal capability by the great Marlene Dietrich, whose motives and role in the murder remain fluid and undecided until the film's final moments. \n",

The performances were very nice (particularly Dietrich's puzzling persona and Laughton's charming curmudgeon), but the plot itself swings around in fits and starts, with a humorous introduction to Sir Wilfrid's character followed by protracted periods of flashbacks that serves mostly as context for the more engaging courtroon scenes and the final twist reveal. Still, it all comes together as material to flesh out each of the individual characters and provide more of a justification for the dueling of personalities rather than dry fact, and makes for a very entertaining film regardless. \n",

Where this movie really shines for me is the ending, which I genuinely did not see coming. This movie kept me guessing and presented a fairly interesting story. A lot of newer movies will have twists and surprises for the sake of having them but I thought they were well put together in this movie and never forced. I think if you like these sort of mystery movies, this classic is a very good example of it. The movie has aged a bit in some ways, but because of a well put together, its a movie that will hold up well for years to come.\n",

            "I had always known that Marlene Dietrich was a great movie star as she has a striking face, lilting German accent and a certain je ne sais quoi that few other performers could touch. She had never stood out as a brilliant actress to me however as her work in Morocco (1930) and The Garden of Allah (1936) largely rely on her glamorous screen persona and do not give her the opportunity to extend herself. It was a shock then to see her give a delightfully frothy comedic performance in a Billy Wilder film as she utilizes her sex appeal and ability for slapstick comedy to great effect. She is the primary selling point of the film as while Elsa Lanchester and Charles Laughton are entertaining enough you can't help but miss her when she is not on screen.\n",

Robards defends his client, believing he is guilty, but their case is complicated by the fact that Vole's German wife Christine, Marlene Dietrich, serves as a witness for the prosecution as she claims that she and Vole are not officially married as she is actually married to a German man and accuses her husband of being guilty. Robards wins the case because he is able to find evidence that suggests that Christine was lying. Revelations about the source of his information leave him confounded and his loyalties must shift.\n",

            "Few directors have as light a touch as Wilder as he produces possibly the best film adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel by leaning into the comedic aspects of her stories and playing to the talents of his cast. He is able to propel the film along at a relatively quick pace making us more invested in the characters than in the courtroom drama. He gives Laughton, Lanchester and especially Dietrich room to play and there is that occasional touch of melancholy that he would put to such good use in The Apartment (1960). He doesn't get lost in unnecessary details surrounding the mystery as some directors would have and gives the film an episodic structure that is somewhat necessary with a film like this. He was deserving of his Best Director nomination as while few would count this among his strongest work he pulls together a story that could have fallen into disarray in the hands of a lesser director such as Kenneth Branagh.\n",
            "\n",
            "The performances are really what needs to be discussed because as much as Wilder's sure hand is indispensable he needs the work of a talent like Laughton to make the film shine. He has bluster and more than enough gravitas to make us slightly afraid when he takes against those around him but he is also playful and charming in his own way. He finds particular inspiration in scenes when he is asked to engage in verbal sparring with Lanchester as his put downs of her and prissiness in response to her properness elicits laughter. Much must also be said of Lanchester who is delightfully buttoned up in a role that gives her some great dialogue to work with and allows her to put her guileless expressions to good use. Power makes an interesting murder suspect as he is effectively mercurial, likable at one moment and sinister at the next, with his use as a supporting actor being better than his efforts as a leading man in The Mask of Zorro (1940). Even Ruta Lee, who only has about five minutes of screen time, is deliciously nasty and rude in the way that only villains in Wilder movies can be as she has touches of Fred MacMurray as Jeff D. Sheldrake.\n",

            "This is the worst Agatha Christie mystery I have ever seen. The essence of Christie is to fill the play with subtle clues and let the audience sort them out. The essence of this play is total misdirection: to have the defendant and chief witnesses appear to be exactly the opposite of who they really are. Also, important circumstantial evidence is totally inconsistent with guilt. For example, the window broken from the outside. The defendant wouldn't have broken the window from the outside because he was a friend of the murdered woman. The woman's assistant was not a credible witness because she was hard-of-hearing and had a financial motive to lie. The letters were not credible because they would have been mailed to Germany, And, the trial itself was preposterous.  Lawyers are not allowed to yell at and argue with witnesses like that.\n",

Our interest in him, in his views of the case, in his thought process, and in his often humorous exchanges with his nurse and colleagues, draw our attention away from the case itself in such a way that we become victims ourselves.

Christie's writing ruminates on the role of witnesses in a trial and how someone can interpret testimony. Wilder's focused direction hones in on each detail to hint to the viewer as to what is really going on throughout Witness for the Prosecution, while also getting laughs from Wilder's playful sense of humor.\n",

            "Marlene Dietrich steals the show with a powerful femme fatale role as Christine Vole, who curiously chooses to swear under oath as a witness for the prosecution against her own husband. She is fascinating with every sly glance and revealing word. Marlene is always drop dead gorgeous, effortlessly enthralling, and dramatically flirty. She commands the silver screen with her awesome star power, heavy gravitas, and captivating dramatic performance. Tyrone Power is excellent as Marlene Dietrich's husband, the defendant Leonard Vole, who is desperately pleading with jurors to accept his innocence.\n",

            "Charles Laughton is delightful as the stuffy and fastidious barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts. He's a by the book defense lawyer with extreme precision and intuition. Laughton's funny, booming voiced lawyer Robarts is a pleasure to watch, especially alongside his real life wife Elsa Lanchester as the meticulous and stubborn Nurse Plimsoll. They have wonderful chemistry on screen together with hilarious comedic timing. \n",

            "John Williams is steadfast as the other lawyer Brogan-Moore, while Henry Daniell has an interesting presence as the solicitor Mayhew. Ian Wolfe's dedicated butler Carter is funny next to Laughton's brilliant lawyer trying to sneak cigars, booze, and additional legal counsel. I liked the friendly and inviting Norma Varden as the wealthy widow Miss Emily Jane French. Irish actress Una O'Connor is a riot as the mean and accusatory maid Janet McKenzie. Ruta Lee even cameos as Diana in the crowd witnessing the trial.\n",

            "In my opinion, if 12 Angry Men is the best film about jury deliberation, The Verdict is the best film about lawyers, Legally Blonde is the best film about cross-examining witnesses, To Kill a Mockingbird is the best film about why a lawyer should represent a defendant, Judgement at Nuremberg is the best film about judges, then Witness for the Prosecution is the best film about witnesses. I think that I was questioning every suspect, motive, and opportunity all the time while enjoying Witness for the Prosecution. I was enthralled by every minute of Wilder's twisting legal picture with Agatha Christie's startling story. Witness for the Prosecution is a must see classic that redefines how you look at courtroom dramas and legal proceedings.\n",

            "Daniel Mandell's editing keeps 116 minutes feeling like 30 with sharp cuts and no unnecessary scenes. Russell Harlan's cinematography has lovely wide shots, but it is his stunning close-ups that reveal whether a character is telling the truth. Alexandre Trauner's art direction is breathtaking with a stark contrast in court between nervous witnesses and calm lawyers to the more rigid English society appearances outside the courtroom. Howard Bristol's set decoration ensures every courtroom and law office looks finely furnished and proper.\n",

            "Matty Malneck's score has an air of mysterious atmosphere and intense romanticism. He composes an intense accompaniment to this legal thriller.

It was also a bit corny like with the nagging nurse such an annoying character. marlene did an excellent job tho esp as the one character holy cow! She was the antithesis to that nurse. The lawyer guy was fairly funny tho.\n",

            "Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie and (trailing a bit behind them because this isn't really his movie, it just seems that way) Alfred Hitchcock walk into a bar... Charles Laughton--turning in one of his finest performances--plays an ornery, acid-tongued, bulldog London barrister hired to defend a frightened Tyrone Power against charges of murdering a ditzy old dowager for her dough.  Twists, turns and more than a helping of humor, supplied mostly by the comically contentious relationship between Laughton and his supremely annoying nurse, Elsa Lancaster (Laughton's real-life wife).  With the great Marlene Dietrich as Powers' loyal (and oh-so-tricky) spouse, and a multi-whammy ending that is one of Christie's best.  Based on a play by Dame Agatha.  Worth seeing--or seeing again--at any time.  A classic.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Witness for  the Prosecution\" (1959) is a gem of a movie from 1959. Every aspect of this courtroom drama is excellent - the screenplay, the plot (by Agatha Christie), the direction, the editing, the dialogues, and the acting. Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester (Charles Laughton's real-life wife), and Una O'Connor (even though her role was relatively small) gave extraordinary performances. I am seeing this movie again after 15 years and I'm glad I didn't remember it. (You won't want to reveal the ending to anyone, even if the producers didn't request it.) Alas, they don't make movies like this any more!\n",

That said, and I'm a sucker for music docs and music biopics, \"Whitney\" is a fascinating look into the life of a global superstar who everyone assumes they know because of this iconic status. The key word there obviously being \"assumes\" as director Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland, Marley) smartly presents the story of Houston's life as we thought we knew it and then brings the audience around to the possible truths of the matter as those being interviewed (mostly Houston's close friends and relatives) came to realize certain truths themselves. In doing so, Macdonald essentially comes to pose a theory by way of what is revealed and how these revelations fueled the demons that it always seemed Whitney Houston never possessed.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is referred to as a \"double consciousness\" is something that seeps its way into every facet of Houston's being and is rather captivating given her life trajectory. Houston was raised in the church, but saw her mother have an affair (with the preacher, no less). She was raised in East Orange, New Jersey-a middle-class suburb-and went to a private all-girls Catholic school, but had roots in Newark. She was bullied in school, but found solace in a single female friend, Robyn Crawford. There was who she was, who she wanted to be, and who she was supposed to be. This only carried into Houston's pop career when she was ultimately bullied by the black community for diverting from her Gospel routes with her troubled relationship and eventual marriage to Bobby Brown seeming more a direct rebuttal to these criticisms than anything else. This is without even going into the topics of her sexuality, her drug use, her role as a mother, her relationship with her father, and how her outlook on each of these aspects of life were influenced from the very beginning. Fortunately, the documentary weaves each of these strands together in expert fashion into a single, complete picture painting a portrait of Houston we've never seen before, but that makes so much more sense and makes her story all the more tragic.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are a handful of quotes given by family members throughout the doc and one by her brother, Gary Garland, that is especially poignant that I won't repeat here as you can hear it in the trailer, but the one that stuck with me most went something along the lines of, \"If you don't know yourself, you don't know what can save you.\" It's hard to believe that in her core, in her soul, Whitney Houston didn't have a solid idea of who she was, but through this portrait Macdonald paints it seems he's landed firmly in the camp that believes Houston was always chasing who she thought she was supposed to be until she didn't care anymore and instead of simply being who she truly was rebelled against that image of who people expected her to be to the point it killed her.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other elements of note are that of how piercing the montage set to \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" comes to be given the reflective nature it is set within and how promising and buoyant young Houston seemed to be. Macdonald also consistently cuts to world events going on at the time of the events the doc is chronicling in the life of Houston as if to lend both a sense of perspective and understanding of the circumstances of that time period; most prominently is that of the fact Houston and her brother, Michael, didn't think of marijuana or cocaine as bad words coming into the eighties...it was just something everyone was doing. Macdonald also acknowledges the tragedy of Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina, and that poor, poor baby's incomprehensible childhood and the eventual hardships and misfortunes it bred.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, I've seen Houston's star-spangled banner performance a handful of times, but when this film touches on what made her rendition of it so powerful (which in and of itself is really interesting and insightful) I still got chills...twice.\n",
            "\n",
            "While there surely is no need for 2 documentaries about the life and death of Whitney Houston in under 12 months; having seen both, I can say that even though they do cover some common grounds, thankfully they do not feel too repetitive. The USP of Nick Broomfield's film last year is the backstage footage of one of her tours that was never released and showed a performer at the peak of her career, while questioning why she succumbed to drugs and other personal or family issues with only a hint of an answer. Less beholden to her music, this new film by Kevin Macdonald asks the same question but we get more of an answer because it has the advantage of exclusive interview footage with Houston's family and close friends which uncovers something new and previously unknown - which makes this the more intriguing and revealing of the two. To that end, this is a respectful and occasionally insightful look into the fall from grace of a true star whose talents served her extremely well and which brought her fame and fortune, and yet unfortunately is still  unable to escape the demons that she is haunted by as a result of her upbringing and the tragedy that she is surrounded by people who do not have her best interests at heart.\n",

            "Documentaries such as these have almost become a tired cliche.  A person from a poor background has tremendous talent and wants to get into the business.  They manage to finally get their break and everything starts off great.  The person experience success beyond even the wildest imagination.  Everything seems to be perfect....until it's not.  For the most part, I just told you the basic structure of 98% of the episodes of VH-1's popular series \"Behind the Music\".  With that being said that does not mean such documentaries are bad.  \"Whitney\" is one of the better documentaries of its type.  I think the film does a good job of trying to get to the root causes of the late Whitney Houston's problems which ultimately lead to her untimely and tragic death in 2012.  The interviews with family members and close friends are well done also and help give the audience an insight to the troubled singer's life and times.  The fact that Whitney's daughter, her only child, died under tragically similar circumstances makes this story even more sad.  Once the documentary ended, I felt I had a better understanding of what caused Whitney Houston's may problems that ultimately cost her everything.  I think you will feel the same way after you have watched it.  I recommend you do.\n",

            "I wasn't a huge fan of Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal's Whitney: Can I Be Me (2017). The film was built on the foundation of never-before-seen backstage footage from Houston's World Tour 1999, but I felt the narrative was poorly constructed, jumping from her divorce from Bobby Brown in 2007 to her death in 2012 with very little detail on what happened in those five years. This had the effect of making the last part of the documentary feel rushed and incomplete. I went into it not knowing a huge amount about Whitney Houston, and I came out still not knowing a huge amount about her.\n",
            "\n",
            "Written and directed by Kevin Macdonald, Whitney covers almost identical terrain as Broomfield and Dolezal, with many of the same interviewees appearing in both films, and much of the same factual information presenting itself (Houston tried drugs long before becoming a celebrity; she was criticised as \"acting white\" and selling out her culture by many black people, and was booed at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards; she was hounded with questions regarding her sexuality for much of her life, etc). One hugely important absence from both films, of course, is Robyn Crawford, Whitney's one time best friend, road manager, and probable lover, who was pretty much the only person in Houston's life who seemed to tell her what was what and have her best interests at heart. Apart from a beautiful obituary for Esquire (on whose editorial staff Crawford's wife works), Crawford has maintained a dignified silence since Houston died, and neither Broomfield and Dolezal nor Macdonald were able to persuade her to speak on camera. This leaves a sizeable lacuna in the narratives of both films, as it is fairly unlikely anyone will really get to the core of who Houston was until (or indeed if) Crawford decides to tell her own story.\n",
            "\n",
            "For all their similarities, however, I found Macdonald's film superior to Can I Be Me. Whitney has two major, and interconnected, advantages over the earlier film. Can I Be Me is more concerned with facts, and probably covers more \"Did you know\" moments, such as the idea to open \"I Will Always Love You\" capella style was actually Kevin Costner's. However, having said that, Macdonald does manage to squeeze in a couple of not especially well known moments of his own; for example, Houston's haunting rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at the 1991 Super Bowl was completely unrehearsed, and the revelations regarding Dee Dee Warwick are shocking to say the least. \n",
            "\n",
            "However, what Macdonald does much better than Broomfield and Dolezal is that, on several occasions, he takes time out from the narrative to simply let the audience hear her sing. Probably because of this, his film is considerably more emotive. I was very moved by it on a couple of occasions; I don't remember being moved by Can I Be Me at all. One scene in particular I found very upsetting recalls that horrific scene in Asif Kapadia's Amy, where Amy Winehouse is performing in Serbia a month before she died. In Whitney, it's footage from her Nothing But Love World Tour 2010, as she tries and completely fails to sing \"I Will Always Love You\" in Newcastle. The crowd is respectful enough, but given that so much of the documentary is simply about her voice, seeing her like this is very sad, as with her hoarse voice, she can barely stay in tune, let alone hit the high notes, sounding more like someone doing a bad karaoke rendition than one of the greatest singers of all time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another very well handled part of the documentary's narrative is its coverage of what could be termed \"mainstream media complicity\" in her suffering. Look, Whitney Houston was a drug addict and a terrible mother, who was indirectly responsible for Bobbi Kristina Brown's death, insofar as she gave her child no stability, and introduced her to a world of substance abuse. Nobody is arguing anything different. But she was also a person, suffering deeply, in public, and very few people did, or even tried to do, anything to help her. The film presents a 2002 sketch from Saturday Night Live with Maya Rudolph as Whitney, in which she addresses the infamous Diane Sawyer \"crack is whack\" interview, and a scene from a 2005 episode of American Dad!, in which an emaciated Whitney \"sings for crack\" in the Smith living-room. These clips were probably funny at the time, but aren't especially funny now, and they serve to highlight one of the most bizarre paradoxes of our celebrity-obsessed society; we love to build people up and up and up, but, at some arbitrary point in time, we decide they've become too popular, too successful, too talented, so we do anything to pull them down, and when something goes wrong in their lives, really catastrophically wrong, our response as a society is not empathy, kindness, or understanding, but scorn, derision, and sarcasm. What a strange world we've made.\n",

That's not to say she is to blame for Whitney's death; it was because she was a grounding influence on Whitney. Interviews with her bodyguard revealed a lot. When he approached her management team (her parents/family) in trying to save her from the drugs and bad influencers, he was dismissed. I guess they believed that saving her from the drugs would stop the gravy train $$$. Shameful excuse for parents, a cheating husband on top of it. Poor Whitney.

            "Less a personal odyssey than a political commentary cast through a historical lens, Spartacus may be the least \"Kubrick\" of the great films put out by the director, who took over another filmmaker's half-finished project and was still bound by many of the restrictions of conventional Hollywood, and it shows. Most of the director's touch is evident in the battle scenes, where his flair for wide shots and meticulously crafted choreography is immediately evident. The themes are relatively simplistic, but timeless, and the performances are great all around. It is certainly a strong film among the many mid-century epics, but doesn't topple such greats as Lawrence of Arabia, nor does it match the entertainment value of Ben-Hur. (4/5)\n",

            "Spartacus is a typical example of big budget, 3 1/2+ hour, historical epics that populated its time and it is a fine one at that. There are so many great decisions though it is hard to know who to credit them to. Apparently, Kubrick himself did much of the work that was credited to Cinematographer Russell Metty and there were many alterations made to Dalton Trumbo's script by actors who desired changes to their parts. The whole thing comes together to deliver a tale of epic proportions and intimate emotions. The best moments don't really come from the huge battles pitting thousands of extras against each other(though they are very impressive). Instead it is the small moments of human connection – the brush of hands against each other or an embrace of brothers in arms- that truly gives the film its gravitas. It's courage to deal with some grotesque issues head on and its lack of squeamishness with the violence and sex it portrays sets it apart from some other films of its time. The film loses momentum slightly every time it has to cut from Spartacus and his army back to the political drama of the Senators in Rome for more of Trumbo's not-so-thinly-veiled messages about persecutions made by those in government. With the exception of some California plant life that doesn't quite fit into the Roman country side and some lazily used day-for-night filters, the whole production was quite something to behold. The late great Kirk Douglass delivers every impassioned speech of freedom with a deep and moving sense of conviction. All of this is underscored by Alex North's wonderful score.—————–Overall: A superb swords and sandals epic that delivers an emotionally satisfying piece of cinema in both large and small scale ways.———Highlight: The scene when Spartacus and Antoninus fight over who dies quickly and who will be crucified(both of course want the other to get the painless death) is so compelling in its portrayal of human love.\n",

            "\"Spartacus\" finds a lot of (what we'd later discover were) Kubrick's trademarked abilities stymied by the last gasps of the studio era, but it's still fascinating to see how the man navigated through such daunting material in such a notoriously limiting period of film history. In many ways, I could see the argument of this being the biggest film he's made in terms of scope, storytelling and just how much effort went into everything in front of the camera. With regard to my enjoyment of the picture, though, I'm of two minds. The actual \"Spartacus\" stuff is magnificent. The character himself is just a blast to watch. Kirk Douglas is in top charismatic form here and all the battles are intoxicating as well, representing some of the only times we get a clear glimpse at an unmistakable Kubrick at work. The palace intrigue stuff was a bit more difficult for me to get into, ultimately leaving me thirsting for more swashbuckling.

However, I wouldn't consider this movie a must see any longer: the action and the romance have noticeably aged and don't work as good as in the 60s, and this makes the 3 hours a little harder to withstand. Despite that Spartacus remains a comfortable movie to watch and return to, with a strong morale that will never grow old and some brilliant performances, especially by the supporting actors that create deep and complex characters, sometimes witty, sometimes funny, sometimes sly.\n",

And Peter Ustinov as the slave owner is just dynamite, an effortless performance that will take me deep into his filmography.\n",

            "This movie ended differently than I thought it would for a bit (in a very good and powerful way) and I liked the battle scene with the Romans and how it started, plus the famous \"I'm Spartacus!\" scene. The acting and dialogue were a bit outdated but it was very good for the time, and I can now finally see how so many films copied the material from this one (such as Gladiator and Braveheart). While I liked the 10 Commandments more and while this was an overly lengthy movie to watch, it remained impressive and I was hooked from the very beginning. It's important to watch older films that are actually original for the time that they came out, and Stanley Kubrick will always be the ultimate king of directing movies! RIP and RIP to everyone else who participated in this production.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a much underrated classic.\n",
            "First, the writing. It is excellent throughout. Yes, there is a lot of controversy as to whether Ustinov wrote his own dialogue and what role Kirk Douglas played in changing lines on set - that's all trivia. Dalton Trumbo wrote a great script. From the very outset, he knew he had to write a script where the title character was crucified at the end  - and yet the movie had to 'uplifting.' He succeeded. The dynamic between the characters is always electrifying. And the love story - well, it is one of the best ever put on screen. \n",
            "Next, the acting - again, it doesn't get any better. From Douglas' teeth-grinding action scenes to Olivier's smooth but uncompromising Roman dictator-in-waiting to Jean Simmonds masterful performance of a slave woman searching for a way to be free, there are few movies that can boast the kind of top to bottom great acting that htis movie has. \n",
            "Then, the other parts that make a movie rise above the rest - starting with its director, Stanley Kubrick. This is an epic movie told at a persoanl level. Some of the scenes are so well staged ans hot that they take your breath away. Russell Metty doesn't have the reputation that some cinematographers have, but this movie shows what he could do when given the chance. Alex North's score is heralded as one of if the greatest score ever written for a film. Saul Bass did the credits and they are outstanding - yes, the credits are worth watching! \n",

            "\"Spartacus\" has that old-school epic feel that few films of today have. This is undoubtedly a long movie, but it tells a complete story. The production value is so impressive and even more so considering when it was made. I enjoyed the film's big moments and felt a bit hit or miss with its dialogue-heavy and talky moments. Sometimes I felt completely engaged and other times a bit bored. Nonetheless, the movie has plenty of entertainment value, particularly at the beginning and near the end which makes it a worthwhile experience. I also think the performances and characters are well thought out here and I really did feel immersed in the world it was wanting to create. Kirk Douglas gave a really memorable lead performance here and it carries the movie in any areas it may lack or feel dated. Overall, this is one of Kubrick's earliest big movies and it is a solid part of his diverse film library.\n",

            "Spartacus may look like an average movie that has the similar 1950s look, but Stanley Kubrick still call all the shots on this movie. I love Kirk Douglas' performance as Spartacus, the action sequences, the story, and the camera shots. There is nothing bad about this bad except that Kubrick didn't have any creative control. At least this movie helped Kubrick put himself into Hollywood. Overall, Spartacus showed his bravery in front of my eyes.\n",

In many ways this movie feels ahead of its time, it features some graphic violence not seen in movies of this era. **SPOILER** The tragic ending is really sad, and it shows how much they make you care about these characters that it hits as hard as it does without crossing into melodrama\n",

The Philadelphia Story is an amusing movie that has a wonderful cast on sparkling form and a capable director. \n",

            "Cherrypicking the best of the acting talent of the A-listers of Hollywood's Golden Age for its three leads and providing some exceptionally clever and biting dialogue for the time, The Philadelphia Story is a major landmark in popular American film. Grant is charming as all get-out, Hepburn brings a sharp wit to stage a career resurgence, Stewart is characteristically wholesome, and Hussey leads the supporting cast with a memorably barbed and aloof peformance that earned her an Oscar nom despite her relatively brief appearance. That said, it's got some weaknesses; parts of the romantic dynamic are woefully dated, and some aspects of the plot are a bit convoluted for their own good (the switched identities, for one). As far as I'm concerned, nothing can take the crown from Capra's It Happened One Night and the pure chemistry between Gable and Colbert for the top pre-war rom-com, but The Philadelphia Story is still a memorable and above all well-acted standout of the genre.

Grace Kelly was better than Hepburn and that is the more important role in the movie. Jimmy Stewart was the best in this movie and I felt like Cary Grant didn't even want to make this movie.

            "It may be difficult to imagine now, but in 1938 and 1939, Katharine Hepburn was extremely unpopular with Hollywood and with the American public. A string of box office failures, coupled with her abrasive and combative behavior with the press and fans, had garnered her a reputation for being extremely arrogant. Seeking to reignite her career she returned to the stage, starring in a new play by Philip Barry. That play was The Philadelphia Story. She would perform the role of socialite Tracy Lord in two tours and on Broadway for over a year. When Hollywood decided to produce the play as a movie, Hepburn had already purchased the rights to the story (thanks to help from Howard Hughes), so she was guaranteed the role. Teaming with Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart for the movie version of the play, Hepburn's shrewd selection of this vehicle paid off. The Philadelphia Story would become one of the biggest movies of 1940, and Hepburn's career and public perception were back on track.\n",

            "Tracy is a divorcee living with her parents and her precocious younger sister, and she is engaged to be married again. This go-around she will marry George Kittredge, a dull businessman who dotes on her but who is out of place in the world of wealth which Tracy is accustomed to. When word of the wedding gets out, the publisher of Spy Magazine sends reporter Mike Connor (Stewart) and his girlfriend, photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), to cover it. To help facilitate getting Mike and Liz the inside scoop, the publisher is sending another employee of Spy Magazine with them. That employee is C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), Tracy Lord's first husband!\n",

Soon, it becomes unclear who Tracy will end up with, as she discovers the depths of reporter Mike which she wasn't expecting. The two of them share a drunken evening together, the night before her wedding is supposed to take place. And of course, her feelings for her first husband are also reignited. While you know from the get-go that Tracy is never going to marry George… what you don't know is who she will end up with, or if she will end up with anyone at all. The suspense of how the tale will end beautifully lasts right up to the last few minutes of the movie. \n",

This is based on a play, and one of my few minor quibbles is that it does feel stagy from time to time, but it just sparkles! The cast is uniformly iconic, from the leads to small supporting parts. Interestingly, Stewart is the one who won the Oscar for this film, but the sun rises and sets around Hepburn here, and she is glorious. People tend to forget that she was a brilliant comedienne, and she is radiant here. Some may question the twist at the end, and it's frankly not necessarily the way I wanted things to go, but this is an old fashioned fairy tale. If nothing else, this is a fascinating study of how the romantic comedy genre has changed the last 80 years.

At the same time quite progressive for its time, but also there are some outdated problematic misogynistic and abusive relics that, unfortunately, still prevail today.

The rest of the supporting cast is good also. Overall the acting is phenomenal. The music is the one weak point, while its good when used it isn't used enough. Which makes it a big surprise that this never comes across as dry. This is actually excellently paced. The firs bit just throws us into the plot and than we get back story on everyone. While this is a bit jarring at first once Hepburn & Stewart start interacting the film never lets up and builds perfectly. The editing is excellent also weaving effortlessly between the 3 love interests, Hepburn, and the writing story. The writing story surprisingly becomes a subplot and the romance takes over. The cinematography is excellent. While this the camerawork is solid but nothing special and in black and white it manages to shine because of the memorable setting and amazing chemistry of the leads and the beauty of Hepburn is always in focus. Add in witty dialogue and some light hearted humor and each scene lights up with charm especially as things progress. The only knocks I can give this is I wish it had more music, and a little more development between Connor and Smith but that's about it. Everyone should give this a try once.\n",

The film did a great job capturing the era. Everything from pop culture to music to the sports of that time period was well represented on screen. For a child of the 80s and 90s this film was nostalgic in many ways. The film had some minor faults. The tension of the story never really felt real, mainly because we knew how it ended anyway. There was no major character development for anyone. The real development was in, and I guess this was the real point of the movie, the industry itself.

Siendo en este caso posicionar a una de las marcas más reconocibles actualmente al ojo público masivo de la mano de un deportista que se convertiría para muchos cómo el mejor “deportista de la historia”. Un cast maravilloso encabezado por un Matt Damon encantador, una fotografía atrevida que rememora lo vertiginoso de los comerciales de finales de los 80’s e inicios de los 90’s, envuelto en un entorno en el que no importa a dónde volteemos conmemora a dicha época. Esta película está lejos de ser grandiosa o que tenga pretensiones más altas que las que expone, pero el sentimentalismo de triunfo que transmite hace que sea casi imposible no encariñarte con la historia.

Fred Astaire proves himself to be the best dancer as well as one of the best comedic actors of the era. Ginger Rogers is just as essential to the movie's success, as the only dancing partner of Astaire who could truly match his talent. The sets are extravagantly fake, the costumes are extravagantly stylish, and Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore are hilarious as always.

Madge's best friend is Dale Tremont, Ginger Rogers, who is financially supported by flamboyant Italian fashion designer Alberto Beddini, Erik Rhodes, whose clothing she models. Tremont is annoyed by Travers when he begins tap dancing in the room above hers and angrily confronts him for doing so. Travers is immediately attracted to her but due to a misunderstanding she believes that he is Hardwick and is disgusted by the fact that her friend's husband would attempt to pursue her. Travers and Tremont grow closer when they dance together in a rotunda in the rain. Tremont is still resistant to his affections and turns down his proposal to marry an insistent Beddini. Travers is overjoyed when he learns that scheming from their friends means that Tremont was never officially married and when she learns his true identity they are able to be together.\n",

            "Even in describing the plot I realize how paper thin it is and how it is really just a vehicle to have Astaire and Rogers dance but this really does not matter as most of the film is taken up with the dancing and the moments in between don't drag. Rogers throws out one liners to put off Astaire while he is totally besotted with her and you have the typical \"Foreigner\" who mispronounces words and is ever so slightly effeminate. The fact that these tropes have been spread across almost every Astaire and Rogers collaboration does not make them any less enjoyable to watch and the actors are so committed to their roles that you can believe their characters. The film had many screenwriters but fortunately the film is tonally consistent, the jokes are family friendly and you would never think that this was a screenplay that needed the input of so many different creative forces. When I describe the film to friends in a few months I likely will not be able to remember the plot but it is commendable that when watching the film it does not get in the way of the primary attraction: the dancing.\n",

            "To describe the dances in the film is hard because Astaire and Rogers are so excellent at what they do and make such a fantastic pair that you could never really put into words what makes them so brilliant. They seem effortless even when carrying out the most difficult of dance moves and there is a fluidity to their movement that is not present in lesser musicals. Astaire collaborated with Hermes Pan on the choreography in the film and it is clear that Astaire played to his strengths here as he gets many chances to show his tap dancing ability while he would seem to be flying as he whirls Rogers around or navigates his way around the ballroom. There are also scenes reminiscent of Busby Berkely in which we see several other dancers carry out an elaborate dance sequences which involves fabric and partnering and a million other little details that I could not even pick up on. Every set in the film looks totally fake and you never believe that you are not watching a film but the dancing is all real and it says something that nobody has topped Astaire and Rogers since their legendary run in the 1930s.\n",

The dance\\song sequences perfectly fit into the narrative and what a narrative it is, it rightfully has earned a reputation of a flawless picture, hello to 'La La Land'.\n",

            "Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers make quite the pair. And there are few times that their star power is able to shine more than in Top Hat. It's a simple story which stretches the bounds of believability  at times, but the lead couple is so charming and talented that you can't help but smile as you watch it. Audiences loved Top Hat back in the day, and I think if you give it a chance, you will, too.\n",

            "\n",
            "Without a doubt this is an All Time Classic. The acting is very good with amazing chemistry between the two leads with witty dialogue throughout the whole runtime. The editing is very good with the only minor issues being sometimes the film has some graphical hiccups (black spots & lines appearing) but that is more than forgivable given how old this is. Outside of that the minimal editing during dance numbers works excellent. The pacing is very good also with the only minor issue being sometimes dialogue can go on for just a bit too long but its still good so your far from ever being bored. The cinematography is excellent overall which is very impressive given this is in black and white so having the backgrounds look so memorable and lavish is a huge achievement with each setting being unique. The camerawork is very simple allowing full focus on the performers at all time and letting them shine. The dance numbers are amazing to watch. Beautiful settings, great catchy choruses, and fantastic dancing makes every number memorable and loaded with charm. This & Swing Time are highly recommended for anyone starting out learning about Fred & Ginger. This is one of those musicals that is so good you really don't even have to like musicals to enjoy it. It's that good.\n",

            "TOP HAT (RKO Radio, 1935), directed by Mark Sandrich, marks the fourth teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and considered by many to be their best collaboration. A reworking in plot from their earlier outing of \"The Gay Divorcée\" (1934), TOP HAT, in fact, the most admired of the two, could easily pass as a partial remake, rehash or possibly a sequel, mainly due to the sameness in the casting of Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes and Eric Blore from \"The Gay Divorcée\" also directed by Mark Sandrich. Stepping in for Alice Brady is Helen Broderick, whose deadpan humor and dry-wit personality proved more amusing than Brady's dim-witted character. Also similar to \"The Gay Divorcée\" is Ginger Rogers singing one song near its conclusion while Astaire provides most of the vocalization.\n",
            "\n",
            "The story opens in London. Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) is an American dancer (what else!) who is to perform in one of Horace Hardwick's (Edward Everett Horton) upcoming musical shows. They share a hotel suite together where Jerry has an urge to sing and dance. His tap dancing disturbs a sleeping patron in the room below. Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers), the upset hotel guest in question, comes up to the room above to register her complaint. After Jerry meets his complainer, he immediately falls in love with her, and decides to soft-shoe her to sleep by dancing on sand after she returns to her room. During his stay in London, he pursues Dale whenever he can, and sweeps her off her feet by dancing with her in the gazebo in the park during a rain storm. Because she doesn't know his name, she affectionately calls him \"Adam.\" Dale, who is to later meet with her best friend, Madge Hardwick (Helen Broderick) in Venice, Italy, discovers she's playing matchmaker, hoping to pair her with her husband's friend, Jerry, while, in turn, Dale believes Jerry to be Horace. Things get really complex as Dale mistakingly believes Made to be pushing \"her husband\" over to her while poor Horace, the innocent bystander, is being being threatened by Dale's dressmaker, Alberto Bedini (Erik Rhodes) and given a black eye by Madge for no apparent reason. Also adding to the confusion is Bates (Eric Blore), Horace's faithful servant, assigned by him to follow Dale Tremont and find out more about this \"gold digger\" out to trap Jerry, and ....\n",
            "\n",
            "Aside from TOP HAT being long on laughs and complications becoming more confusing and the story moves on, the film takes time for five classic dance numbers composed by the legendary Irving Berlin: \"No Strings, I'm Fancy Free\" (sung and danced by Fred Astaire); \"Isn't It a Lovely Day to be Caught in the Rain\" (sung by Astaire/ danced by Astaire and Ginger Rogers); \"Top Hat\" (sung by Astaire); \"Cheek to Cheek\" (sung by Astaire/ danced by Astaire and Rogers); and \"The Piccolino\" (sung by Ginger Rogers and chorus/ danced by Astaire and Rogers); and \"The Piccolino\" (reprise, finale). Of those numbers, \"Cheek to Cheek\" remains a true highlight, a scene clipped in many documentaries pertaining to movie musicals or Astaire and Rogers themselves. \"Cheek to Cheek\" was nominated for best song of 1935. Although it didn't win, it remains as memorable as the Astaire and Rogers dance itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "Any similarities between THE GAY Divorcée and TOP HAT are purely coincidental, but in many ways an improvement. Both films are not only the most famous and televised of the Astaire and Rogers musicals, but each presents itself like a stage play. The only twist here is that TOP HAT, which borrows from \"The Gay Divorcée\" is actually an original screenplay (by Dwight Taylor), written especially for the leading pair. Other than the horse and buggy ride on the London streets, the focal point remains mostly in the hotel suites, lobbies, dining areas and a brief ride on the gondola. TOP HAT gives the impression to be the most lavishly scaled musical ever released by RKO. It does. Even Ginger Rogers' dresses are glittering and rich in appearance, right down to her sleeping attire. A musical fantasy by way of costumes (how many women sleep with nightgowns flashier than a dinner dress?), TOP HAT has Astaire singing and dancing during portions of the plot, a common practice musical stage shows, though the title tune, \"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\" is the only one given the production number treatment played to a theater audience on screen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Classic Hollywood musical is a light screwball comedy interspersed by skillfully directed and choreographed song and dance sequences, a perfect product of Tinseltown diversion; albeit, it's generally Fred Astaire's talent that makes it shine.\n",

            "In my opinion you don't need to be a fan of old black and white movies to see the appeal of this musical classic\n",

            "Awesome! 1935!  Loved it. Great cast. Even Lucille Ball in a very minor back up roll I've seen it on the movie channel once maybe twice in 2020. 1935!\n",
            "\n",
            "I laughed out loud and cried.  Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers--so young and so beautiful.  The deadpan humor, many costume changes, including the feathery cloud with plunging back for the Dancing Cheek to Cheek number, and Astaire's irrepressible good humor. His signature casual elegance on the dance floor delights. He is the icon of Top Hat and Tails. The supporting cast was great too, Edward Horton of Rocky & Bullwinkle fame and Helen Broderick's comic smarts.  Not to mention the music of Irving Berlin.\n",
            "\n",
            "The best Astaire/Rogers movie musical\n",
            "\n",
            "Convoluted rom-com misunderstandings and a general lightness of plot aside, \"Top Hat\" is a nicely snarky and cleverly dialogued song-and-dance film. The way Astaire can make even the simplest of tap-dances more interesting with setting and props makes him the Jackie Chan of musicals. And \"I'm in Heaven\" really is a beautiful little standard.\n",
            "\n",
            "I secretly wish men still wore top hats and tails and that in real life people broke out in song and dance for no apparent reason.\n",
            "\n",
            "The 1930s was also the perfect time for the fluffy escapism and froth of the musical. This was the decade of Depression when many people were struggling to survive. The general public welcomed the chance to go to the cinema to get away from their daily hardship and bask in the luxury of a good musical.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is what Top Hat offered in spades. A world of conspicuous consumption far removed from the daily grind of living opened up before the eyes of cinema audiences. This was a world where everyone dressed smartly, even the butler. Some characters got to wear the titular top hats, which were large and shiny. Hotel rooms were improbably large. A rich man could land a seaplane in the middle of Venice.\n",
            "\n",
            "Obviously that could never happen, but then Top Hat did not deal in the real. Compared to later movies such as Don't Look Now which were genuinely set in Venice, Top Hat offers an entirely absurd portrayal of the city which looks like nothing but a studio set. It is a multi-layered, spotlessly-clean Art Deco affair with a few tiny canals and gondolas available. The beautiful set ate up a large part of the budget for the film, and is a treat to look at, but it is certainly nothing like Venice, and the filmmakers did not care.\n",
            "\n",
            "These were the golden years of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, that enormously popular dancing duo. Astaire was the charming and likable dancer and singer whose casual elegance would change fashions in male dress sense for some time to come. Rogers was his lovely partner who performed the same dances with him, often while wearing heels. Her shoes had to be frequently changed because they were filled with blood.\n",
            "\n",
            "The plot is really not that important to enjoying Top Hat. Astaire himself complained that the film had no substance or plot, and he is right.\n",
            "\n",
            "That is partly the difficulty faced by many musicals. They are not cinematic in a conventional sense. They are almost anti-cinema. Story, dialogue and tightly-constructed plots are anathema to the musical. The task of the director is to film the musical without getting in the way too much, which is why Mark Sandrich, director of half the Astaire/Rogers collaborations is not remembered as a great auteur.\n",
            "\n",
            "Astaire himself did not want too much attention being paid to clever cinematic techniques during the dances. This is why we do not see many cuts or unusual camera angles during these scenes. We only get one brief shot of the dancers' feet at the beginning of the movie's last dance. Mostly the camera stays at eye level, moving just enough to keep Astaire and Rogers in the centre of the screen. The focus here is on their performance, and not on fancy filmwork.\n",
            "\n",
            "While Top Hat is therefore unsophisticated as a work of cinema, it is not a worthless movie. The choreographed dance sequences were taken every bit as seriously and as meticulously planned as the work of any serious film director. The artistry lies in the dancing and the music, not in the moviemaking.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the head of it all was Fred Astaire, the perfectionist who insisted on recording the dances in long takes and without many breaks in the scenes. Think of the stamina required by Astaire and Rogers, and yet they do not even look tired. Astaire dances gracefully, his feet seeming to beat out a tune of their own, and his arms moving almost as much as his legs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Astaire was not averse to the use of props, most notably the cane that he uses to ‘shoot' the other dancers. To make the scene, Astaire kept thirteen canes to hand because he kept breaking them. Fortunately he completed the shot when he was down to the last cane. While musicals are often lengthy, Top Hat was ruthlessly cut, with eight songs removed and a number of scenes removed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Such cuts certainly help to keep the momentum of the story going, but what was left in is just as important. Top Hat contains some of the most memorable songs found in any Astaire movie. Many people who have not seen the film will have heard snatches of Top Hat or Cheek to Cheek, songs that have found a life of their own outside the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "The credit for the songs goes to Irving Berlin, a composer of extraordinary talent who had not even learnt to read or write music. He wrote the songs, and Max Steiner wrote the score. Berlin developed a comfortable relationship with Astaire, and the collaboration between Astaire and Berlin was just as remarkable as that between Astaire and Rogers, albeit behind the scenes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some critics would argue that Swing Time was an even better Astaire/Rogers movie. Nonetheless Top Hat remains a favourite with many, a sunny movie that continues to put a smile on people's faces over eighty years later.\n",

            "Pretty much film perfection. No this doesn't have a groundbreaking plot. It doesn't have a life long lesson to take and hold onto. It's just a damn fun and diverting ride that tries and always succeeds. It tries to make you entertained, it tries to keep you tense when needed, it tries to have engaging characters and scenarios, but above all, it tries to remind you that life doesn't always have to be wrapped in evil backed by cynicism. Sometimes, life can just be as beautiful and simple as Fred and Ginger falling in love and dancing to a new melody.

            "Fred Astaire is a fantastic dancer, sure, so light on his feet and making difficult moves look easy, but he's also an engaging as an actor.  With his slicked back hair and those sly eyes, his interest and wooing of Ginger Rogers is charming.  He's also smooth as he breaks out into several songs from the fantastic score by Irving Berlin, including 'Cheek to Cheek' (\"Heaven...I'm in heaven...\") and 'Top Hat, White Tie and Tails' (\"I'm...puttin' on my top hat...tyin' up my white tie...\").  It's such an iconic moment when the men's chorus momentarily disappears in the latter number, and the lights dim while Astaire dances solo; it's as if we're seeing a genius creating something out of nothing.  I think my favorite performance was Ginger echoing Fred's moves in 'Isn't This a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain)?'  She is something special as well, with as great a timing in the delivery of her lines as the timing in her dance moves, which she often performed in heels, a cumbersome dress, and needing to go backwards more often.\n",

The premise is that Rogers thinks Astaire is the one married to Broderick, which, while silly, creates a number of humorous moments between the various characters.  Blore is delightful in his cheeky role, and sometimes seems to be at the center of it all.\n",

Maybe that under the production code, some of the edge is sanded down?  I don't know.  For the musical genre, this is a landmark film, and I almost feel guilty not giving it an even higher score.  There were certainly transcendent moments for me in the dancing; it was as if I was watching perfection, two people so supremely skilled and alive that it was if they never could have possibly aged, or been broken down by time.  Perhaps with this film, we can imagine that they never really were.\n",

I didn't see any story-telling value in making the wife Italian. 2. I realize people may quickly become infatuated with each other, but for the nomad photographer to invite this married Iowa farmwife to spend the rest of their lives - based on a couple of days - together was intellectually insulting. 3. On a small but irritating point, no man in 1965 was wearing his hair coiffed like Eastwood. 4. Most enjoyable for me was seeing the period-correct vehicles. A must-pass.\n",

He was unconvincing and frankly too old for her.  He is a stud and looks the part in his T shirt on or off...but candidly, he lacked fluidity in his motions.  He looked old.  Beyond his physical mismatch his acting was wooden and it was almost absurd (I've watched the movie 3 times in 20 years) how poorly he acted next to Streep.  Streep had great lines and her accent was terrific but it goes beyond even that, her breathing and glances and pent up frustration was so palpable.  I think the ending was weak and Clint looked foolish as he turned in the middle of the road, almost hynpnoic-like; and somone might say, duh! He is a phenominal actor...I'd say, sorry, not seeing it.  This is one of those rare movies -  you almost never prefer a remake - but I am convinced a remake is what's needed.  Clint is the man...let me emphasize that, from Dirty Harry to Gran Torino...but he simply was just borderline awful in this role...not at all believable as the person Streep's character was having intense erotic feelings about.\n",

There are some nice pieces of dialogue and I did feel quite emotionally connected to Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streeps character).

I liked how there was a contrast where he was able to open up toward Meryl Streep's character and had his passion lit. Streep, on the other hand, showed passion, responsibility and no regret to the love she had in her heart. Liked the integration of a historical landmark, but the film could have possibly more essence of Madison County rather than just limited to the bridge or the two characters' intimate moments.\n",

As the two begin going through their mother's belongings, they discover that she once had a very brief yet intensely meaningful affair with professional photographer Robert Kinkaid (Clint Eastwood).

When her husband and two children head off to the State Fair, Francesca elects to stay home in order to have four days to herself.  Fate intervenes when photographer Kinkaid arrives in her driveway to ask her for directions.   He's visiting Madison County to photograph its covered bridges for National Geographic magazine.  Francesca offers to ride with him to help him find Roseman Bridge and the two strike up a conversation that leads to dinner as the two discover their mutual admiration for each other.  Neither has any intention of advancing things beyond friendship and discussion.\n",

This role garnered Streep with one of the twenty-one acting Oscar nominations she has received.  She unveils the mundane despair that Francesca endures with a magnificent deftness.  Francesca's history is fully established through Streep's facial expressions and physicality.   Eastwood, who is the film's director, is sublime as the earnest and passionate Kinkaid, a character keen from his observations of life and the bigger world.  It's a wonderful departure from the gruff and angry characters he typically plays.  \n",

            "My one complaint with the film is that the actors playing Francesca's adult children in the \"current day\" scenes are quite dreadful.  In fact, the first 15 minutes of the film set in current day is like watching a poorly directed and poorly acted junior high school production.  The staging is bizarre, and the dialogue is utterly contrived.  Then switch to the past and Streep and Eastwood somehow convert that junior high feel into a Broadway production.  The transitions are jarring because of the drastic contrast in acting skills between the two time-periods.  Thankfully, Streep and Eastman prevail… as does the film.  It's a touching tale, and one well worth experiencing.\n",

The plot is quiet and a bit inconsequential but I think that actually helps in this case as Empire of Light ends being more of a showcase for extremely talented people than a story that needs to be told.\n",

            "Empire of Light is a film that never really ignites. It has all the elements to be great but at times is muddled and overstuffed. There are great performances there but overall I found it a little lacking. The great English director Sam Mendes wrote and directed this film and apparently it is a very personal one for him based on memories of his childhood. It is set in 1980 in an English seaside town and the film focuses on an Art Deco cinema that has seen better days. Hillary works as the duty manager but she is mostly depressed. She is having an affair of sorts with the married cinema manager. When a young man named Stephen begins work there it brightens her life and she eventually forms a strong bond with him. There are various other characters who work at the cinema and we see a little of their lives too. Stephen is black and has bigger dreams but also feels the weight of racism of those times. It feels like it's made for a potentially great film but it's surprsingly mundane and a bit leaden. And I think it tries to do too much, trying to combine stories of cinema history, mental depression and racism just don't come together as they possibly should. But the performances are great. Olivia Colman is superb as usual and so is Toby Jones as the projectionist. And the cinematography from Roger Deakins is great as expected. Some nice moments but a wasted opportunity.\n",
            "\n",
            "I thought Empire of Light was solid - a sugarless drama with a middle aged Olivia Coleman that struggles with mental health. And a young Michael Ward that is trying to find his way through a racist movement. Working at the theater brings them together and is the petri dish for their issues to blossom.\n",

Nothing to special about it but nothing bad this film leaves you feeling no different from when you went it. The discrimination was done well in the fact it showed what type of issues were on in that time and was one of the best parts of that movie.

            "\n",
            "Mendes directs a marvellous and touching Olivia Coleman (even if too prone to tears) in a soulless drama. Margate (Kent), 1980: vice-director of Empire cinema Hilary Small, who suffers from depression, starts a secret relationship with one of the new (and younger) employees, Stephen (Micheal Ward), a black British not well liked by the people of the city. Their boss, Donald Ellis (Colin Firth), takes advantages (no s) of Hillary's mental problem, consuming an unfaithful sex relationship with her. Mendes tries to mix several differents themes and stories without going really deep in any of them: love, racism, joy and the beauty of the cinema (and music), depression (and schizophrenia). All these elements don't receive the necessary space, closing the movie behind the facade of the Empire, with only some fleeting scenes out. The movie indeed tries to talk about racism without explaining the context in which it occurs (anche takes place): we only see a verbal harassement to Stephen and the beating during the motorcade. The nostalgia effect is reached very easily, an aspect highlighted in many films in the last decade (Babylon, The Fabelmans, La La land just to mention some), and here doesn't add anything more to the ones I mentioned before. To conclude, it's a film that need to be seen for its wonderful cinematography (candidated to the Oscars) that explores and expandes all existing shades of yellow and for Coleman's performance. Yet the film itself loses the focus without leaving a lasting trace.\n",
            "\n",
            "Watchable but that's only because of Coleman's performance. The script is almost entirely unbelievable, clearly the product of the fact that Mendes hasn't interacted with any normal people for decades.\n",

            "I really don't know what the critics were thinking on this one. I loved it completely. Lyrical, quiet and atmospheric, Empire of Light rings all the bells without all the whistles. Wonderful performances and a remarkably light touch over very heavy country.\n",

Paired once again to feed our moviegoing taste buds by capturing the classic theatrical establishments, and the results don't disappoint because it now appears they're in-synced by synergetic mise-en-scene with graceful faith. However, it looks good, but it doesn't sound equally as much due to disconnected drama addressing the associated themes becoming a priority over its selling setting that became a backdrop settlement. The cinematography aim's on par with the direction in closer filmmaking relationship, the writing, based on prior experiences absorbed, projected hits and misses that downplays any engagement or disables any sympathy over its poignant undertone. What qualified the film is finding it rewarding over the aesthetical focus towards the backdrop and the performances finding quality in their deliveries, but its re-watchability gets put into question when dealing with the lack of solid focus that doesn't see Mendes at his best upon a squandered opportunity. Understandable by proportions, it's the melodramatic obligatory that wasn't given the same amount of focus in eventfully taking place within a favorable setting. (B-)\n",

She wants to quit because her fiance' is about to land a big promotion and wants to impress his boss at an important dinner.  (She does jokingly mention the flying thing but what really gets her to see the hypnotist is her fiance's dinner).\n",

            "Barbra Streisand has the sort of star power that explodes off the screen.  So effortlessly lovable and so much a force (with her roaring voice, her palpable charisma, and her slicing comedic timing), she's enough to practically blow anyone standing next to her right off the screen if they fail to out-act her themselves.\n",
            "As a result of her being such a titan of the silver screen, finding a vehicle able to contain her has enforced a career full of movies that remain watchable only because Streisand's in them.  The only feature to have spotlighted her correctly is Peter Bogdanovich's glimmering screwball comedy homage  \"What's Up, Doc?\" (1972), which prevails because it recognizes the boldness of Streisand and likens her talents to that of a behemoth of a figure like Katharine Hepburn.  No one opposite her is ever going to stand out as much as she does, and that fact's recognized.  Even \"Funny Girl\" (1968), the enduring musical drama that won her an Oscar, struggles due to its run-time and due to the entire ensemble cast being more wet towel than personality driven.  Streisand, of course, is larger than life in the movie.\n",
            "\"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" her 1970 collaboration with Vincente Minnelli (\"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" \"An American in Paris\"), suffers from the very same problem that has plagued Streisand's long career: she's astounding, but everyone else seems at a loss as to how to keep up with her.  In the film, she is Daisy Gamble, a flibbertigibbet of a post-grad trying to kick her smoking habit.  Possessing an addictive personality that ensures that she consumes five packs a day, her vice has become a problem for her conservative fiancee Warren (Larry Blyden), who's intent to marry her but not if she's going to die of a black lung within a couple years.\n",
            "Knowing full well that she's too flighty to quit on her own, Daisy attends one of the lectures of Marc Chabot (a thoroughly wooden Yves Montand), a psychiatrist with a knack for hypnotization.  Believing that she could enlist him to essentially put her in a trance and command that she stops puffing smoke so fanatically, she introduces herself and, before long, is the patient to his doctor.  But when Chabot accidentally travels too deeply into her psyche, it is unexpectedly revealed that Daisy, in addition to being an airheaded twentysomething, is the reincarnation of Lady Melinda Winifred Waine Tentrees, a sexually confident eighteenth-century social climber that worked her way from poverty-stricken illegitimacy to wondrous wealth in her lifetime.  Chabot keeps this discovery a secret.  But when he begins to fall for the woman Daisy no longer is, complications unavoidable arise for both him and the girl who sits in his office on a day to day basis.\n",
            "The concept, already trippy enough as it is, is poised to struggle to convince.  And yet it works, the fantasy sequences arguably more effective than the ones set in the present day.  But maybe that's only because scenes that take place in 1970 are also characterized by actors that aren't Streisand.  And those actors, despite mostly being renowned, are so bland by contrast that the second any of them so much as open their mouths we find ourselves already pining to see and hear more of her.  When a star acts and sings as magnificently as she does, it's almost unthinkable to sit through a minute in which she's not stealing a moment from another.\n",
            "\"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" then, is forthcomingly a little off-center.  Since its headliner is so sublime, we're sporadically tricked that we are, in fact, watching a great movie.  And we aren't: the story, while sound, doesn't emotionally invest us, and no one not named Barbra Streisand is inviting.  It's all rather stagey, too, not unlike the play from which it was conceived.  So it's good.  But imagine how wonderful it could have been had Minnelli and the film's makers better understood the capabilities of their leading lady and worked with them more efficaciously.\n",

Meanwhile, she falls in love with him.  This is a weird film.  It's a musical, but there's so little music in the film, that it may as well not be.

Despite critical indifference to the musical, a film adaptation was made by the great Vincente Minnelli (Meet Me in St. Louis, An American In Paris and Gigi), it was released at a difficult time when Hollywood was shunning films like this, it's beautiful to look at but like it's main character, it's a bit scatterbrained. It has kooky chainsmoker Daisy Gamble (Barbara Streisand) going to psychiatrist Marc Chabot (Yves Montand) to help kick her habit. Instead, Chabot discovers Daisy has extrasensory perception, and under a spell. Daisy becomes Melinda Winifred Waine Tentrees, a lady in 19th Century England attached to royality, married to the rich Robert Tentrees (John Richardson). Chabot becomes more and more attracted to Daisy under the hypnotic guise of Melinda, but Daisy has little idea of what's going on. It's well made, and the bits in 19th Century England are very well filmed, and it's a clever concept, but it doesn't gel very well. This is a film that could do with a remake. But, it has a BRILLIANT supporting cast including Jack Nicholson, Bob Newhart, John Le Mesurier, Irene Handl and Roy Kinnear!! :D\n",

Instead she regresses into a 19th century England. On and on it goes, nothing happens - endlessly, and fatally there is zero chemistry between Streisand and Montand. When we reach the big title song Montand looks extremely uncomfortable. Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson turn up in thankless roles, and it's very hard to believe this is the work of the great Vincente Minnelli.\n",

Yet I cannot deny having a strangely fun and nostaglic time watching this relic of a film from an old-fashioned director working from, what can only be described as a profoundly nonsensical script .

She is like a doctor reviving a patient in regards to every scene she's in, and it doesn't help that the music in this musical is so displaced that one loses interest quickly. Yves Montand shouldn't have been casted as the psychiatrist, Bob Newhart shouldn't have played serious( because there was nothing funny about his seriousness), Jack Nicholson is barely there, but he is lovely to look at and a relief to see when we see him. Streisand keeps us interested and buoyant throughout this movie, and her characterization of Daisy Gamble, a woman with interesting ESP abilities and her contact to herself in a past life, British \"tart\" Melinda Tentrees gives dignity to this failed attempt as revitalizing the movie musical to the audiences at the time. It insults Vincente Minnelli's ability to direct. Still, Streisand is the only reason to see this movie, she is the only one \"clear.\"\n",

Second, the music is surprisingly good- a handful of stand outs, only a couple of cheesy arrangements, maybe one or two forgettable numbers and no real stinkers. And lastly, I loved the plot. It's never trying too hard to be something it's not, and Streisand really manages to play up the camp and fun. I'd love to see some remakes of this that went harder for the unrequited love angle.\n",

            "This is one of the more plot-heavy Ghibli movies and I think it works better here than usual. There is a relatively complex conflict at play here with multiple factions and agendas. The dark tone adds a certain macabre intrigue to the fluid animation. Princess Mononoke is a very good movie to be sure though not a personal favorite.\n",

            "Instead of a message of preserving nature and that gumans are evil like in the Avatar movies, it praises balence. It gets you to understand and emphasize with both sides. Its about how we need to move forward and make progress, but we cannot destroy nature in the process, as exemplified when the forest spirit was decapitated. The only thing I disliked about the movie was the forced romance between Mononoke and Ashitaka. They had no chemistry and you could have taken out that whole sub-plot, and nothing would have changed.\n",

A maioria dos personagens tem suas motivações bem definidas e com isso, todos tem que lidar com as consequências de suas escolhas e ações. Além disso, o filme ensina que às vezes, o bem contra o mal pode ser na verdade, apenas pessoas magoadas, cegas em suas ideologias ignorando o que realmente importa para a vida.\n",

Such a generalisation has enough truth in it to justify such black-and-white presentations.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Of course Miyazaki sides with the forces of nature against those of destructive human development, but nonetheless he understands the motivations that lead to the destruction of natural habitats. The result is a film in which there are no villains.\n",
            "\n",
            "Miyazaki was a pacifist, and an anti-war message can be detected here. In the conflicts that follow, even those beings who have justice on their side risk becoming corrupted by evil. War and fighting do not bring good. The samurai, the heroes of many a Japanese movie, are shown here as a destructive force, attacking the local farmers and trying to seize control of Iron Town for their Lord.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the beginning it is clear that Iron Town is a place that it is out of step with nature. It is a big metallic edifice from which smoke billows. This is the early stages of human progress, and part of forest is being cleared to make way for the beginning of the industrial age. In this story, Miyazaki said that he wanted to \"portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilisation\".\n",
            "\n",
            "At the head of Iron Town is the ruthless Lady Eboshi. In order to obtain her goals, she has come into conflict with the animal gods that inhabit the forest, and she intends to defeat them with superior firepower. Lady Eboshi has no qualms about killing animals for the protection of hr own interests, or about destroying an old way of life to make way for humans.\n",
            "\n",
            "In many an American movie, such a character would be the film's villain. Miyazaki instead makes Lady Eboshi a more complex character. In the eyes of the men and women working in Iron Town, she is a heroine. She is a reasonable and personable leader, who speaks gently to her employees, winning their unstinting loyalty.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lady Eboshi is a modern character in certain ways. She gives jobs to lepers, an ostracised group in Japan, who were thought to be the victims of deserved karma. She also buys up prostitutes from brothels, and allows them to make an honest living by working for her. This compassion for stigmatised groups makes Lady Eboshi a likeable character, even if some of her aims are misguided, or even horrific.\n",
            "\n",
            "The conflict between humans and animals occupies most of the film. There are three leading groups of animals that often fail to cooperate. There are the wolves, who are accompanied by San, a human child raised as a wolf and a possible love interest for Ashitaki.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are wild boars that have moved into the area purely to fight Lady Eboshi. Finally there are apes who are hostile, but do not fight. One of them comments: \"We plant trees. The humans tear them up\". Other creatures occupy the forest, including tiny little wood spirits, with heads that rotate, a sign of a healthy forest.\n",
            "\n",
            "These animals are not Disneyfied by Miyazaki. They look more convincingly like the actual creatures, rather than cute cartoon realisations of them. They are also not gentle or loveable, but savage and dangerous. They are wild animals, and we identify with them only because the forest is rightfully theirs. Still even their vengeful intentions are taking them on a self-destructive path that will do more damage in the end.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the ending is not a tragic one, it does conclude in some level of defeat for all the characters. There is a chance to rebuild, and some forces will endure, but nonetheless there is a sense that something has passed that cannot ever be fully recovered. As the apocalyptic images at the end suggest, greed and conflict can push our local ecology to the point where it may destroy us all, if not this time, then perhaps in the future.\n",

Released in 1997, the film tells the story of a young prince who after facing a demon and being cursed by it, has to leave his tribe on a quest to stop the curse from killing him. The film explores themes such as sexuality and spirituality, but primarily the symbiotic and often chaotic relationship between humankind and nature.\n",

            "Princess Mononoke is one of the reasons why Studio Chibli hit the mark on it's predecessor much like Spirited Away later on, this one is an absolute masterpiece and just when I am doing this review, I'm just gonna say that the director who directed before he directed Spirited Away, it is Hayao Miyazaki. He works for Studio Gjibli along with two others like Toshio Suzuki and Isao Takahata. They're the ones who are responsible for making animated films beautiful and impeccable entertaining those who are fans of anime. Now that I got that out of the way, let's continue on. An Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon and the last of the Emishi who is a prince called Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curses him. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes a scar-like mark that will surround him, cause him pain, and eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god and the wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands where the demon came from, so he goes out on the journey to find a cure to cure his arm before he dies. Along the way he comes across a young woman named San played by Claire Danes, who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans. Yeah, a woman who is raised by wolves and has hatred for humans. You can see where this is going whilst you kept watching but all I can say is, she's a human too. The only way he can get the cure from his arm is from the Great Forest Spirit who is a deer-like animal god. After the day I watched Spirited Away, I was actually going to go for the ones that are highly rated which of course being Spirited Away itself which is why it's being one of the more impeccable ones that are on that category. That being said is like I said before if you have your own account from many movie websites you will see many lists of highly rated movies you've seen and haven't seen. You cannot go wrong. Despite being a PG film, some of the scenes that can be quite brutal. Well, not to worry, at least they have their uncle's with them. Hahaha. If you're looking at the environment of the message that it contains and you're thinking the same thing like \"Did I ever hear this message before?\" Yeah, like you're thinking about man and nature. And like you're thinking the same story like thinking about this as the Japanese Pocahontas, the Japanese FernGully: The Last Rainforest, the Japanese Dances with Wolves and the Japanese Avatar. Well, I think you guys are having with your head. Next! To be very frank here, this is not the case. There is no character that is considered an antagonist. The way it tells the story is astonishingly extraordinary. Princess Mononoke is absolutely one of the more impeccable animated films and much like the ones I've seen so far when I was a kid and adult which are nostalgic and much like Spirited Away however, this is one of the more powerful films I have ever seen period and that's saying something. This'll be like Star Wars of anime even when you're looking at engaging characters, impeccably beautiful animation and an epic story. For any anime fan, animation fan and film buffs, this is an absolute must-watch. It has every right to be an epic masterpiece and so many who are looking for something powerful and something more engaging, then seriously go see this movie right away. It is everything you want in anime. As much as I love Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke is the absolute spectacle of animation heaven.\n",

Despite this, The Wiz still has its charm and is a fun, energetic take on a classic story.

            "It seems like the idea behind this movie was to minimize the acting and maximize the singing after they cast the two musicians in the leading roles, as even for a musical there was just a radical quantity of songs in this movie. It having a runtime of over two hours didn't help, but it felt like listening to CD after CD of the same genre of music - the effects of later song/dance numbers were dulled by it. Also, I fully expected going in that there would have been some adjustments to the screenplay to account for Dorothy being played by a 33-year-old, but nope - she's portrayed exactly as innocent as any 12 year old would have been, making it a rather bizarre viewing experience when I watched closely, which was very seldom. That's the other thing - the nature of the plot being advanced by wordy song & dance numbers in modern viewing meant that I was looking at my phone for most of the movie and didn't miss any of the plot. This was an ambitious undertaking by Lumet, and felt way outside his wheelhouse.

(Palm to my forehead) It's pretty indescribable. The shots are too wide. It lacks focus. No humor. It doesn't speed it along at a consistent pace. It was just plain bad. I could make a cut of this and maybe bring it to being 1 hr. and 40 minutes instead of their 2 hours and 14 minutes of painful crawl.

I took part in a school production of this and really enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to this. While the Wiz had its good moments, it was so disappointing. I found it too static, too misconceived and too mediocre for my tastes.\n",

            "Starting with the good things, first and foremost Michael Jackson. He is surprisingly good as the Scarecrow, with just about the right amount of energy and innocence for the role. His vocal rendition of You Can Win was thoroughly enjoyable especially. Nipsy Russell and Ted Ross also do nice work as The Tin Man and Lion, and Lena Horne(R.I.P) is a lovely Glinda. Mabel King does well with what she has as Evillene, which admittedly isn't much, though I felt she died too easily. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the songs, Ease On Down the Road is by far the catchiest and the most memorable.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, I hated Diana Ross's Dorothy. I love Diana Ross, but she was not right for Dorothy at all, she is too old in my personal opinion that is, she has been in much better voice before as well and she fails to capture the cherubic innocence of Judy Garland coming off as haggard and whiny. Even worse was Richard Pryor's Wiz, I found him far too loud and cocky, it was as if Pryor hadn't realised he was playing \"the wonderful yet mysterious Wizard of Oz\", because if anything it felt like another one of his comedy skits. The story is good on the whole if somewhat rickety and flow-less in places, but then there are some pointless scenes; I am especially talking about the subway scenes, those scenes were completely unnecessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "I had mixed feelings on the sets. Some are beautiful and expensive-looking but others especially the one in You Can Win looked like sets from Monty Python. Some costumes are nice, such as Lion's and Glinda's but the Winkies's are less successful. The dialogue is occasionally amusing, but it is also very inane as well, Sidney Lumet's direction is very heavy-handed here and the choreography is messy particularly in the Emerald City Ballet sequence and a Brand New Day. The camera work and lighting ranges from adequate to appalling with the lighting in The Munckin Scene too dim and the camera work very static in more than one place throughout the course of the movie. The movie is filmed sometimes at such a distance, you have difficulty empathising with any of the characters and their situations. The pacing is often off as well, as the film progresses the pacing becomes increasingly elephantine and pedestrian. And talk about an abrupt ending, completely unsatisfying and rushed. When it ended, I was like \"that's it?\"\n",

Stunning performances from beloved celebrities at the top of their game, Songs and dances resonate with fresh joy as well as archetypal metaphor, which carries with you over time and gains new meaning as you age.

The thematic approach under first impression is lyrical poetry dazzlingly backed up distractively to properly dissect like any normal approach towards the delicately complex, thoughtful format, hence how Lee connected with what the show means upon realization by eventual clarification of genuine exhilaration that sums up in truly capturing the sensation.

            "\n",
            "This joyous, exuberant concert film by director Spike Lee of a live recording of a Broadway performance of musician David Byrne, based on the title album including songs throughout his career. Within the confined parameters of the square stage, surrounded by grey curtains, Byrne and his marching band, dressed in grey suits and often appearing barefoot, perform their songs. The band uses wireless or portable equipment with lively choreography by Annie-B Parson, and an expressive use of lighting that highlights performers, and even the audience, at crucial moments. Lee puts the camera on stage so we can feel the vibrancy of the performances. There are few unnecessary reaction shots to the audience and he even puts the camera in the rafters, looking down at the performers. Byrne is a performance artist so it has elements of participatory theater as Byrne attempts to convey the need for human connection. The movie culminates with the band's extraordinarily plaintive rendition of Janelle Monae's protest song \"Hell You Talmbout.\" David Byrne, as the lead singer of the band Talking Heads, appeared in Jonathan Demme's concert classic \"Stop Making Sense,\" and Spike Lee's movie is a new modern classic of the genre.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although there's plenty of reasons to admire the films of Spike Lee, and singer David Byrne (who was part of Talking Heads, not it's sole creative force despite album credits) - this live music doco actually gets pretty damned boring about 35% of the way in.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regardless of reviewer hype - the actual gig consists of the following: well rehearsed live music with good intonation, people in bland grey office suits and bare feet doing staged, awkward and uncool dance moves, pretty nondescript bits of stage banter between songs. \n",
            "\n",
            "Byrne first appears in the MINIMALIST (see what I did there, used a fancy word like I'm a private school graduate or something) *ahem* minimalist stage production holding a plastic brain, talking/singing about the brain. He has very well trained pitch and the track is (almost) interesting, but I feel like Laurie Anderson is about to walk onstage and start playing a series of randomized words from a tape deck to amaze (critics?) with the apparently artistic qualities of juxtaposition and decontextualisation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Did I mention the bland grey office suits and dorky stage dancing? There's little warmth or soul in the proceedings, also there's the impression that Byrne split Talking Heads due to the others disliking his overly controlling tendencies, to later be billed as a \"solo act\", really now with a collaborative troupe that are now a hired show cast under his direction. Fans of the era's slightly faceless, compressed audio will find that sound approximated on \"American Utopia\", with some rather lovely percussion sounds added. Casual viewers would be better checking out the groups earlier album releases, or Demme's earlier classic concert film Stop Making Sense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Depending on your taste in David Byrne's music, American Utopia is a great musical essay about our want and need to connect to each other. Blending in with the large band at times himself, and pointing out his own follies, Byrne brilliantly reminds us realize he's as human as the rest of us. Fantastic musicality with minimal props or backgrounds make the poignant moments even more so - yup, I cried. Spike Lee's direction more than makes up for us not being there and one poignant song in general is made all the more impactful by his skilled eye. Brilliant and entertaining show.\n",
            "\n",
            "Seeing the show when it was on tour was great. Seeing it like this was amazing. For such a simple stage set up, Spike Lee shows the power and creativity that can come from the imagination.\n",
            "\n",
            "Spike Lee does his best putting American Utopia on film as opposed to broadway, but frankly, the music just doesn't bring it together and everything feels claustrophobic. David Byrne is a marvel, and the choreography is spectacular, however, the songs in this musical only work when Byrne brings out his Talking Heads material.  Final Score: 4.2/10\n",
            "\n",
            "David had always been  tad off center.. Here he brings back some elements of \"Stop Making Sense\"...For me, that is one of the best concert films of all time...Spike Led directed this effort and there is a bit of LEFT leaning thoughts here and there...Alright, they are artists expressing themselves...I get it...The qroup on stage move continually, but the two lead dancers become annoying after a bit...For me, a little too much...It is a joy to see David performing these days...One hopes for utopia, especially now...but dreams and wishes don't make it happen...\n",
            "\n",
            "A barefooted (Lord knows why but I'm fascinated nevertheless) and grey-suited David Byrne on a (mostly) bare stage runs through his Talking Heads hits and personal favourites (I'm as shocked as I'm ecstatic when Lazy pops up as the third number), he's joined by similarly attired dancers and musicians filling up the stage with oddly hypnotic but strangely compelling choreography in this 2019 Broadway show which this documentary captures in its full glory. For some reason, I expected there to be more of a narrative threading through the numbers but it turns out to be a fairly straightforward concert after all. In between his energetic and boisterous performances, Byrne, the demurred but charismatic raconteur, shines in a few seemingly random anecdotes and musings on a variety of subject matters, ranging from baby neurology to Dadaism and more heartfelt political pleads urging people to register to vote as well as the Black Lives Matter movement. Directed by Spike Lee, his contribution comes into being when he's able to showcase the clever theatricality of the show's lighting and its use of space and depth in lesser known numbers which rightfully get more production. With up to 12 people on stage at the same time, the choreography often turns into dancing in formation and Lee's Busby Berkeley-influenced aerial shots add a new perspective that the audiences are not privy to. Part summary of Byrne's amazing career, part snapshot of where America is at in 2019, this is a joyous and infectious experience that's brimful of positivity. You won't be disappointed if you're a fan and this will be the next best thing to actually being in the audience; for everyone else, you will still be tapping your feet along to the percussive-heavy music which are simply impossible to resist.\n",

            "\"Unfortunately, I am what I am.\" This thing is nearly impossible to categorize. Concert + Broadway production + \"one\"-man show + avant-garde performance art + Ted Talk + stand-up comedy + VH1 Storytellers. It's unique and weird, yet utterly unpretentious, a joint celebration and critique of human nonsense. The songs rule, the band rules, the choreography rules, Spike Lee rules, David Byrne rules.

David Byrne has done an excellent job in bring the music of Talking Heads to the stage, adapting the tunes to theatre form with the help of a superb supporting cast. But how this has got wonderful reviews from many film reviewers baffles me. This isn't a film, by any stretch of the word. Spike Lee directing the footage doesn't make it a film, it just makes it a stage production filmed by an Oscar winner. I didn't see Metallica's S&M 2, their live collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony getting reviewed by any film critics on its release a few months ago. Maybe if James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich had approached Spike Lee to direct the footage of the live show, presumably S&M 2 would then have got 5 stars from the Guardian, Telegraph et al. If you love Talking Heads, this is worth a watch as the songs are pretty untouchable. But it's not a film.\n",

I am glad I took the time to check out \"American Utopia\" because it really is a very unique show and has a great style. I liked a good amount of the music but I would say the type of music in this show is more entertaining to listen to while watching the show rather than on its own.

El Dorado isn't as polished and the cast isn't quite as strong overall, but with the Duke, Robert Mitchum and James Caan in key roles there is no shortage of star power. El Dorado also manages to build the same warm and friendly atmosphere as the earlier film.\n",

Also my favorite of the trio of films that are considered to be pretty much the same by some fans. I recall Rio Lobo to be quite different from this and Rio Bravo and not as good as the other two. Leigh Brackett, the woman credited with making Empire Strikes Back the strongest of the original Star Wars movies, narratively, is the writer here and I only take issue with some of the dialog written for the female lead. A great action film that also features James Caan and Ed Asner, dated mostly by a lack of flowing blood and Nelson Riddle's musical cues which sound like they belonged on the Batman series he was working on at the time.\n",

            "Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they pay their respects, local newspaper editor Maxwell Scott asks Stoddard why a United States senator would make the long journey from Washington to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years. Upon entering the territory as a young attorney, Ranse is beaten and robbed by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang. Tom Doniphon finds Ranse and takes him to Shinbone. Ranse's wounds are treated by Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, and others, who explain to him that Valance terrorizes the residents, and the town's Marshal Appleyard is powerless to stop him. Tom is the only man who stands up to Valance, stating that force is all Valance understands. Ranse is determined that law and justice can prevail over Valance; however, Ranse begins practicing with a gun. Hallie, attracted to Ranse and concerned for his safety, tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom advises Ranse of Valance's trickery. Tom also makes sure Ranse understands Hallie is Tom's girl by showing renovations to his ranch house are intended for his marriage to her. Shinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the statehood convention at the territorial capital. Ranse and Dutton Peabody, the local newspaper editor, are elected, despite Valance and his gang's attempt to bully the residents into nominating him in order to represent the cattle barons. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight to be held later in the evening. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines...\n",

            "Liberty Valance was released in April 1962, and achieved both financial and critical success. Produced for $3.2 million, it grossed $8 million, making it the 15th-highest grossing film of 1962. Edith Head's costumes were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design (black-and-white), one of the few Westerns ever nominated in that category. Contemporary reviews were generally positive, although a number of critics thought the final act was a letdown. Variety called the film \"entertaining and emotionally involving,\" but thought if the film had ended 20 minutes earlier, \"it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny,\" instead of concluding with \"condescending, melodramatic, anticlimactic strokes. What should have been left to enthrall the imagination is spelled out until there is nothing left to savor or discuss.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin agreed, lamenting that the \"final anticlimactic 20 minutes ... all but destroy the value of the disarming simplicity and natural warmth which are Ford's everlasting stock-in-trade.\" Despite this, the review maintained that the film \"has more than enough gusto to see it through,\" and that Ford had \"lost none of his talent for catching the real heart, humor and violent flavor of the Old West in spite of the notable rustiness of his technique.\" A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that \"Mr. Ford, who has struck more gold in the West than any other film-maker, also has mined a rich vein here,\" but opined that the film \"bogs down\" once Stoddard becomes famous, en route to \"an obvious, overlong, and garrulous anticlimax.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \"a leisurely yarn boasting fine performances,\" but was bothered by \"the incredulous fact that the lively townsfolk of Shinbone didn't polish off Valence [sic] for themselves. On TV he would have been dispatched by the second commercial and the villainy would have passed to some shadowy employer, some ruthless rancher who didn't want statehood.\" John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Director Ford is guilty of a few lengthy, slow periods in his story-telling, but for the most part the old, reliable Ford touches are there.\" Harrison's Reports gave the film a grade of \"Very Good\", but Brendan Gill of The New Yorker was negative and called it \"a parody of Mr. Ford's best work.\" More recent assessments have been more uniformly positive. The film is considered one of Ford's best, and in one poll, ranked with The Searchers and The Shootist as one of Wayne's best Westerns.\n",

            "This John Ford classic is somewhat a bit too talkative if you ask me and yet again I think James Stewart is paired with a much stronger actor, in this case John Wayne, within the western genre. \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" becomes more of a James Stewart drama than a John Wayne western. It´s nicely shot, it contains of many great scenes and Lee Marvin is as evil as only he could be. Rest in peace Lee. But, it´s not enough in my book. There´s something that doesn´t make ends meet for me at least. And I don´t think it´s John Ford´s best movie as some claim.\n",

            "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance should have been made at least a decade before it was. Many of the supporting characters are there for comic relief and are extremely exaggerated, something that fit better in a ‘30s adventure like Stagecoach than it does in a ‘60s drama like this, and the political and societal aspects of the plot often make it feel like Mr. Smith Goes To the West and Then To Washington. Unfortunately, Jimmy Stewart isn't as young as he was in 1939 and struggles to be entirely believable as a young up and comer, but he still delivers a compelling performance alongside John Wayne at his most heroic and cynical, although not young enough for his part either. However, it wouldn't have worked with any other actors as the characters of Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon seem made for Stewart and Wayne respectively. The story is powerful as well, telling of a man who gives up his girlfriend, the spotlight, and credit for his action to a man he believes is more capable and deserving. The film combines the pensiveness of The Searchers and the tenderness of My Darling Clementine, a feature that suggests John Ford did need to wait until 1962 to make this film in order to allow these ideas time to fully evolve. Even so, and unlike the two previously mentioned films which very much fit their decades, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance feels out of place, like a newer movie (for the time) dressed up to look old or an older one made to feel new, not unlike Jimmy Stewart playing younger and older versions of his character.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the best Westerns of all time John Wayne, James Stuart and Lee Marvin give Oscar worthy performances apart from the star studded cast this film tells A great story of good vs evil an absolute classic must watch if your into westerns\n",

            "John Ford directs what is arguably his finest Western drama The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). It's gripping with serious gunshots and men standing up to vicious bullies and robbers. I was also surprised at how funny and lighthearted much of Liberty Valance is with plenty of comedy relief. This is also Ford's most explicitly political film as he demonstrates through the use of an ethical lawyer the moral imperative of voting in the democratic process.\n",
            "\n",
            "James Stewart is fascinating as the lead Ransom Stoddard with his guffawing at Western violence and stalwart upholding of democratic ideals. He has nice chemistry with the lovely Vera Miles' country girl desiring real love Hallie Stoddard. Her earnest fondness for quiet country life is matched by her joyful spirit over learning to read. John Wayne doesn't waste a second of screen time as the quickdraw master and rancher Tom Doniphon. His tough guy persona feels more heroic and realistic than ever before in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. There's some hilarious back and forth between Stewart and Wayne.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lee Marvin is phenomenal as the brutal villain Liberty Valance. Marvin's deep booming voice rages against the law and decency with his visceral silver whipping, rapid fire shooting, and fearsome snarls and insults. You've never seen Lee Marvin this scary before for sure. Alongside Marvin's terrifying Liberty Valance is Lee Van Cleef's surly henchman Reese appearing out of the dark to scare Edmond O'Brien in one of John Ford's best shots ever. Edmond O'Brien and Andy Devine are hilarious in supporting roles I will not spoil. John Carradine cameos at the end with a flurry of flowery Southern gentleman speeches full of lies and political spin. The entire cast is just amazing in hindsight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dorothy M. Johnson's story lets you see how a strictly moral man may be led down the path of violence to convince the violent of the way to progress.

            "\n",
            "John Ford's direction is all about misdirecting the audience about the meaning of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. His heavy use of black and white camera tricks, silhouettes, and shadowplay still looks striking today. His compelling and visceral, creative direction lead Ford's narrative on conveying the range of toughness required for both gunslinging as well as legal upheaval to bright heights.\n",
            "\n",
            "William H. Clothier and Carl Manoogian's cinematography uses bursts of white light to guide all the shrouded darkness of the old West. Their black and white cinematography features heavy use of shocked gritty faces in stellar close-up shots and perfectly framed wide shots to see all the action. Liberty Valance has this slick stark look that appears like its a film noir with Ford's iconic Western style.\n",
            "\n",
            "Otho Lovering's editing is super sharp with hard cuts all over Liberty Valance. He keeps Ford reigned into a swiftly paced 123 minutes. Farciot Edouart's visual effects are dazzling from gunfire to shattering glass and much more. Cyril J. Mockridge and Irvin Talbot compose a killer Western score with exciting swells of symphonic danger, helping the feeling that anyone can get hurt or killed in the wild West without the law being enforced. Edith Head's costumes are very cool from Jimmy Stewart's proper suits, John Wayne's cowboy classic look, and especially Lee Marvin's wicked rogue aesthetic.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance must be seen by all fans of Westerns as it features some of James Stewart, Lee Marvin, John Wayne, and Vera Miles' best acting alongside John Ford's best direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "Directed by John Ford, and starring Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, and Andy Devine, this is a western par excellence.  While the territory of the story is not named, \"the picket fence\" is a name for the Purgatoire River that is in Colorado.  The story told is of a time in the American west when the rule of law wasn't yet established, and the bullying powers of wealthy cattlemen could be a terrifying force.  This is a great movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although the plot twist at the end was phenomenal, there was a lot of extra scenes and plots in the movies. For example, the love triangle with ranse, Tom, and Hallie was very unnecessary. Also the final scene in the flashback, when a new group tries to put their candidate up over ranse because he is a murder was also unnecessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne were about ten to 15 years too old for the film to be absolutely perfect. But, director John Ford's wise storytelling has aged well.\n",

            "Following my initial viewing of this film, I had to take some time out to absorb what I had just seen. I had been as deeply moved by it as I had by any film, let alone those restricted to the Western genre. I wasn't ready yet to reflect on the depth of my experience. I had seen a movie which had functioned perfectly at both intellectual and emotional levels; serving both to entertain and to offer a profoundly deep philosophical perspective on the dividing line between civilization and savagery; diplomacy and the law of the gun. The film is perfectly cast and immaculately executed; it is bittersweet, poignant, intelligent, and profound. It has the strengths of the emotionally distilled qualities of the Western format while also leaving us pondering its intellectual implications in a fashion reminiscent of the most profound moral philosophies. It draws a line in the sand which challenges us to examine the tenuous nature of civilization while simultaneously engaging us at the more direct level of fulfilling entertainment that most film-viewers crave. It is more than a Western, it is an awe-inspiring testament. It ranks among my all-time favorite Westerns, and is surely an masterpiece to be cherished.\n",
            "\n",
            "John Ford delivered another great film with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Lee Marvin makes a truly evil villain.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is sometimes seen as being an uncharacteristically pessimistic film by John Ford. It is not exactly that. As the title promises, the movie's leading threat will be removed. Law and order is established in the frontier town of Shinbone. In these respects, the story is more conclusive and upbeat than the end of some Ford movies – The Grapes of Wrath, Two Rode Together or How Green Was My Valley, to name a few.\n",
            "\n",

The film is also representative of ongoing struggles with racial integration which were going on in 1962, when the film came out. John Wayne is at his most John Wayne, which is to say, not much.

Nevertheless, the obvious and more taxing work is from MacLaine, a closeted lesbian at that time, whose darkest secret has been catalyzed by a contumacious girl's fallacious slander, her confession scenes is one heck of a sensation which persists to impress audiences from generations on. Shamefully, the only acting nomination from the Academy is for the venerable Bainter, who is in every way deserves it and even the win as the moral yardstick at then to reprimand the \"unspeakable sin\" and becomes the victim of her own (and her granddaughter's) deeds, one may wonder, what will she act if ever she finds out the truth of the story, it's a vivid rendition full of nuances and certainly upgrades her role's credibility from a one-note slant.

Once a film loses your engagement I think it is hard to get back on, but I did for the end and it was okay. The acting was in my opinion all very good with Hepburn and the girls mom (Fay Bainter) being stand out performances. I think the second is one of the many reasons I liked this film so much.

Audrey Hepburn shines as well (as does Garner), but then they have little else to do but to pick and play from the handbook of those unrighteously condemned, whereas MacLaine has self-loathing to contend with in spades. The child actress has a mountain to cross as well, convincing the audience of her latent evil intent, and often borrows too heavily from the Nicolas Cage handbook of overdoing it, but all in all the production makes it point, and is resonant.\n",

Mary Tilford is the vilest child in cinema history - she makes Rhoda from THE BAD SEED look like Shirley Temple. I won't detail the horrible thoughts I had about this child, but they weren't pretty. Both leading ladies are outstanding, and it's a bit puzzling that at least one of them were not among the five Oscar nominations this received. The only acting nomination was a richly deserved nod for Fay Bainter as Mary's grandmother who sets the wheels in motion. It's a tribute to the skills of legendary director Wyler that the drama is so intense, it almost begins to feel like a suspense film. One can sense that this was originally a play, but it doesn't feel stagy at all. The adapted screenplay couldn't be improved upon, and even the minor characters feel fleshed out and crucial to the goings-on. And what a rare treat to see a cast almost entirely female, with the exception of a never-better Garner. I could continue my praise, but I'd rather sit in a dark room and enjoy a few more evil thoughts about Mary Tilford.\n",

            "Another one of the best movies of 2013! Minor issues I still had but it totally makes up for everything fans and critics complained about with the 2009 movie Director James Mangold handles this second solo outing of the most popular X-Men character making it more somber Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/Wolverine for the 5th time but he’s a former shell of himself living a lonely existence in the woods no longer in the Xavier mansion feeling adrift He has nightmares about losing the love of his life Jean Grey wanting to be a pacifist But another mutant named Yukio finds Logan urging him to come to Tokyo, Japan to say goodbye to Mr. Yashida He was a soldier Logan ended up saving during the bombing of Nagasaki and wants to thank him on his deathbed; there’s more though as Yashida offers to make Logan mortal! Will he go through with it, finally putting an end to his curse of living forever? After all a man like him with his mutation can run out of things to live for, not being able to die can be a heavy burden watching everyone else die, everyone wants to find love and have a family and one day grow old, can we actually find peace through mortality? He also has to save Yashida’s grandaughter Mariko from the Yakouza The action is a lot better here, the Japan setting is genius having Logan go up against the Yakouza with swords and the character gets to know what it’s like being a ronin warrior facing the choice of continuing to go on or become human He’s got more of a soul, a pathos along with being multifaceted The fight sequence during the bullet train is very intense Yukio’s power of seeing people’s deaths is interesting but weighs heavily on her, a very lively performance by Rila Fukushima Although the other mutant Viper who is immune to every poison could’ve been better and some things in here I had trouble getting on board with particularly the adamantium Plus from what I’ve heard they didn’t exactly do the Silver Samurai justice mainly the climax (should’ve been a bit bigger) The Japanese perspective from Americans is a bit complicated when it comes to diversity But they do go a bit more hardcore here, one scene in particular actually almost made me flinch cause it matched the maturity of the comics Jackman does wonders as usual having this character go further on a beaten path figuring out how to live, he’s not only haunted by death but by life’s eternal struggle Mangold’s direction allows him to have the character be more grounded rather than be strictly tied to the X-Men universe surrounding It feels less comic book-like being a more dramatic human piece with strong performers\n",

A lot of characters just belnd in except Logan and the Daughter for the most part. Her archer lover, ther brother, the over the top Poison Ivy rip off villian, all just sort of blend in. Logan & Mariko kind of have chemistry but Mariko but not enough to really light things up. The cinematography isn't bad but can be quite messy and a bit all over the place. Most of the problems are in the first half. The CGI is very hit or miss at times including the bullet train scene which is the CGI in a nutshell, cool but shotty. The camerawork sometimes is a bit all over the place. Some of the fights are shot like a Bourne Movie, The night scenes just blend in and are forgettable, but than in the second half the fights do get better and are done decently with some creative scenes. The music, editing, and pacing all fall into the same catagory as well. The problems are really in the first half. It can be very messy editing wise in the first half throwing  alot of plot lines from the grandfather dying, the Viper villian, the daughter, Logan's relationship with Mariko, all of it is done in a very unfocused way that doesn't naturally flow and instead thrown all at once at us. This movie defintely saves itself in the second half when it slows down with introducing new ideas and focuses on Mariko & Logan. On top of that as said before the action scenes get signifcantly better as well and all the ideas do make sense. It can feel like this is a corporate sucession drama mixed in with a Japanese Action Superhero Movie and it takes a while but it works enough. It definetely could've worked better if the first half would've had a tighter narrative and cut the Jean Grey scenes and when he's meandering in the woods. That all felt unecessary and contributed to the problems of the first half. This should'nt have worked on paper but it is entertaining. Anyone who is a die hard fan of the X-Men franchise should check this out.\n",

It does start to kind of lose that touch when you get into the more generic side of things. Generic villain, and some generic action. I do however like the more complex relationship that he had with Logan. It adds more depth to his character. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed the action we got in here.

The story about wolverine loosing his self healing was very well written and thought provoking. The main theme in this movie is mortality and what you will do with your life. One big complaint I have is one of the side villains: serpent. Serpent was a horrible villain and did not do the movie justice.

            "Reviewing a Tarantino movie is an interesting quandary for me. He has yet to make a movie that I haven't liked - a couple have been more disappointing than others, but I have yet to give one of his movies less than 3 stars. More than any other filmmaker I've seen, his joy of movies and movie making is almost overflowing, and this movie is no exception. I described it this way to a friend - \"Really liked it a lot, borderline loved it, but I didn't get the \"wow\" feeling I did over some of his others.\" This film is almost 3 hours but the storytelling is so compelling that it feels half that long. He makes the unusual choice of using some modern music although the film takes place the 1850s. Still on the fence how I feel about that, although no filmmaker in general is more brilliant in using music in his movies. Waltz is best in show, deserving his Supporting Actor Oscar although I would argue he is a co-lead. DiCaprio still comes across to me as a little boy playing dress up - perhaps it's because I remember him as a child actor. All in all, I would rank this in the upper-middle of Tarantino's film. And as always, those offended by language and violence should definitely pass.\n",

It boils down to exploring the edge of vertical doom-lands of snow and ice, getting terribly hurt, being left for dead and a man's ultimate survival instincts. How the one dude still believed being an atheist was cool after his life was so clearly in the hands of God's mercy I find unfathomable but hey -- fools fall off mtns just as regularly as wise guys. So it rains on the just and the unjust. The movie is not one to be entertained by as much as vicarious adventure on the edge of assured doom yet sensing the unmistakable intervention of the grace of God for these guys in their both walking & crawling out of the gelid tentacles of Death in the frozen wastes of Peru.

Taking the MCU where it has never gone before, director James Gunn opened the doors to the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe.\n",

After attempting to steal from the thieves, Star-Lord goes on the run in an attempt to cash in on his treasure. With Yondu placing a bounty, Quill is targeted by intergalactic outlaws Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) & Groot (Vin Diesel), as well as the daughter of Thanos (Josh Brolin), Gamora (Zoe Saldana). Upon realizing they share a common goal, this group of outcasts must band together, as the galaxy's last hope against Ronan the Accussor (Lee Pace).\n",

Creating a visual masterpiece, every minute of this mostly CGI space journey looks vibrant and believable. From seeing the fibers shake on Rocket's face to the crackling oasis in the cosmos, the careful design and execution paint an unforgettable picture. Rooted in comedy, Gunn seamlessly integrates humor into the adventure, with jokes that consistently elicit laughter. Balancing that out with dramatic and heartfelt moments, Guardians of the Galaxy feels like a complete package.\n",

With characters like Groot becoming household names, kicking off a critically and financially successful trilogy, and paving the way for James Gunn to eventually oversee the DCU, the achievements of this film are astounding in and out of the genre. With deep and layered characters, devoted actors, and an imaginative director, Guardians of the Galaxy remains an incredible modern space epic.\n",

Indy travels back in time, is seen crying on a mountain top begging that he wants to stay behind and bleed to death in the past because his wife (Marion) is divorcing him because of his sons death in the war;  Indy blames himself for.

What is though most annoying, is the fact that for a whole movie named Indiana Jones, Dr Jones is discredited constantly and not because it makes sense in the story, but only for the replacement character that lacks character to look good. There were many opportunities that could allow Indiana Jones to excel in some scenes based on his knowledge, experience and veteran status, and in some physical aspects to appear as the old man he is and depict the inevitable fact everyone is growing old, while the new character could be the opposite. But no, again Disney had to bring the female character who is better at everything than Indiana Jones in an Indiana Jones movie, and honestly made him obsolete.

You briefly see a spark in his eye over the thought of this opportunity. He obviously doesn't have many years left and letting Indy spend his final years there would have been the perfect send off. But nope. The female obviously knows what's best for Indy and she knocks him out with surprise blunt force trauma. Next thing you know, Indy is waking up back in the present.

            "\n",
            "Right from the intriguing opening frames, Fincher fully immerses the viewer in Button's bizarre but beautifully tragic world. The incredible makeup and visual effects work to de-age and age Brad Pitt throughout the different stages of his life is simply astounding. We watch in wonder as Button progresses from a fragile elderly man in his final days to a playful baby and curious young boy. The level of detail put into Benjamin's evolving appearance is uncanny and helps make his reversal of natural aging profoundly convincing.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to the groundbreaking visuals, what elevates The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to masterpiece status is the deeply soulful performances by Pitt and Cate Blanchett, who plays love interest Daisy. Though their timing is constantly out of sync due to Benjamin's condition, the authentic, raw emotion between these two iconic actors is palpable. We feel every ounce of their longing to be together despite the extraordinary challenges facing their relationship. Blanchett in particular gives one of her career-best performances, imbuing Daisy with an incredible warmth and vulnerability. \n",
            "\n",
            "Fincher brings a heart and patience to the story that one wouldn't necessarily expect from the filmmaker known for darker thrillers. Though the plot spans decades, he finds a way to make Benjamin's journey utterly captivating from start to finish. Major events of the 20th century serve as the backdrop, but the film remains laser-focused on examining the timeless human themes of love, loss, and aging. \n",
            "\n",
            "Each phase of Benjamin's life feels lovingly crafted and authentic. Whether it's him experiencing childhood for the first time as an old man, or Pitt's nuanced physicality to portray the frailties of late old age, you completely believe in the journey of this unique character. As Benjamin witnesses the true fickleness of time, so too does the audience gain a new appreciation for each fleeting moment.\n",

            "The production design, costume work, and John Williams' emotive score are also integral in transporting the viewer so comprehensively to another era.

Even small background details have been paid such exquisite attention. \n",

            "Although not devoid of sadness, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is ultimately filled with hope, wonder, and a celebration of life itself. It's hard not to be moved by the perseverance and zest for living demonstrated by Benjamin and Daisy against all odds. Few films capture the beauty, pain, and meaning we can find even in our finite moments as movingly as this masterwork. David Fincher has crafted a true cinematic achievement - at once imaginative, emotional, and profoundly human - that will no doubt continue to enthrall and inspire for generations to come.\n",

If I have to get into some negatives there isn’t a lot for me but some of the execution is good not great but soild and sometimes the exact timeline of things is a little murky. But in the end, this is a pretty solid film interesting an interesting concept. Grade B\n",
            "\n",
            "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film that explores, through a well crafted, but unusual story, what it means to be human, to love, and to suffer loss. Told as a story through the reading of a diary to Daisy, the principal female character, by her daughter against the backdrop of Hurricane Katrina (although this was probably done to give the film a foundation in time). Bearing only a passing resemblance to F Scott Fitzgerald's original story, the changes made here turn this story into a much richer experience that is less of a novelty, and much more compelling. The film explores the concept of how we view love at various stages of life, and whether we are ready to love when there is a seeming age difference. The start of the film when there is the first flicker of connection between Daisy and Benjamin appears to our senses to not feel right. Benjamin, a young boy who for all intents and purposes appear to be an elderly man, with a young girl who is just that. This feeling of something not being right is played out in the film and, if anything, is a critique of human judgment in the face of appearances. At this stage you feel that Daisy is the only person who connects with Benjamin as a young boy. As they age together they drift apart and reconnecting is disrupted by the realities of coming of age and exploring the world. I won't say any more about the story except that there aren't any plot twists or unexpected turns. You know what is going to happen, but that itself is alright. It is a life story, and a love story that you want to be involved in. Well done to David Fincher for being brave enough to take on the task of pulling this off almost flawlessly. It is wonderfully filmed and the long running time matches the gentle pace of the film. So, to sum up, this is a very sweet and gentle exploration of the human condition that is well worth three hours of most people's time. A very good watch.\n",

The plot is good but the film is very long and I felt the present day scenes with old Daisy and her daughter were unnecessary and made the film feel like a drag at times. The effects used to make the characters look older are good. Overall there is a good movie here but the long unnecessary length and unlikable female character makes this a one-time watch only.\n",
